## ACS
The GDG chose to assess recommendations as “strong” or “qualified,” in accordance with GRADE guidance.13 A strong recommendation conveys the consensus that the benefits of adherence to the intervention outweigh the undesirable effects. Qualified recommendations indicate there is clear evidence of benefit but less certainty about either the balance of benefits and harms, or about patients’ values and preferences, which could lead to different decisions.

* Regular mammography starting age 45 (Strong recommendation); Annual 45-54; Biennial 55-69
* Continue at 70 and beyond if overall health is good and life expectancy greater than 10 years
