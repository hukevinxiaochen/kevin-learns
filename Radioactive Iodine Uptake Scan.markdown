High uptake correlates with de novo synthesis of thyroid hormone

Low or absent uptake indicates either inflammation and destruction of thyroid tissue with release of preformed hormone into circulation or an extrathyroidal source of thyroid hormone.

e.g.

* Struma ovarii
* Factitious thyrotoxicosis
* Iodine supplementation/exposure (IV contrast, amiodarone, iodine)
