Our ED is split into 2 levels (first floor and the mezzanine level) of the Feinberg Pavilion of NMH. If you are scheduled to work on Team 1 or Team 3, you will be working on the first floor. If you are scheduled to work on Team 6, you will be working on the Mezzanine level.

Team 1 meets at the computers across from room 5, Team 3 meets at the computers across from room 10, and Team 6 meets at the computers across from room 61.

There are signs on both the 1st floor and the Mezzanine level that will direct you to the appropriate location in the ED. The first floor in particular is divided into geographical teams depending on where you are scheduled. 

You will be working with a senior ED resident (PGY 3 or 4) and an attending during each shift and they can help you on your first day to get things going.

Regarding dress, you may dress in scrubs + your white coat. Each area sees a wide range of acuity, however there is always a higher risk of bodily fluid exposure in the ED (compared to clinic), so definitely prioritize scrubs.

Some residents choose to wear Northwestern or other non-institution specific zip-ups or sweatshirts over their scrub top (esp as the temperature starts to drop), which is completely fine, as long as it's professional (eg I wear a non-descript black 1/4 zip up with no writing nor logos over my scrubs).
