## Classic Presentation
● Encephalopathy
profound disorientation, indifference, and inattentiveness

● Gait ataxia
Ataxia primarily involves stance and gait and is likely due to a combination of polyneuropathy, cerebellar involvement, and vestibular dysfunction. When severe, walking is impossible. Less affected patients walk with a wide-based gait and slow, short-spaced steps. Gait abnormalities are appreciated only on tandem gait in some patients.

● Oculomotor dysfunction
Nystagmus, lateral rectus palsy, and conjugate gaze palsies reflect lesions of the oculomotor, abducens, and vestibular nuclei. Ocular abnormalities usually occur in combination rather than alone.
