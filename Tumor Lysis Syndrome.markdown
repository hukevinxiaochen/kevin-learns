# Tumor Lysis Syndrome
## Pathogenesis
In the setting of malignancy with:

* high proliferative rate
* large tumor burden
* high sensitivity to treatment

Initiation of:

* Cytotoxic therapy
* Cytolytic antibody
* Radiation
* Glucocorticoids 

Leads to release of massive quantities of intracellular contents:

* Potassium
* Phosphate
* Nucleic acids that can be metabolized into uric acid

Resulting in:

* Hyperkalemia
* Hyperphosphatemia
	* 4-fold x normal concentrations in malignant cells
	* Calcium-Phosphate Product > 60 = increased risk of precipitation in renal tubules
		* Renal Replacement Therapy likely for CPP > 70
* Secondary Hypocalcemia
* Hyperuricemia
* Acute Kidney Injury
	* Uric acid precipitates readily in the presence of calcium phosphate crystals and calcium phosphate crystals precipitate steadily in the presence of uric acid crystals
* Xanthinuria
	* Allopurinol prophylaxis is common to prevent hyperuricemia and AKI
	* But this can lead to Xanthine build up
	* Which can also precipitate to cause AKI

## Manifestations
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Diarrhea
* Anorexia
* Lethargy
* Hematuria
* Heart Failure
* Cardiac Dysrhythmias
* Seizures
* Muscle Cramps
* Tetany
* Syncope
* Sudden Death

## Diagnosis
### Cairo-Bishop Classification
Proposed in 2004.

#### Lab TLS
Two or more abnormal lab values of:

- [ ] Uric acid > 476 micromol / L or 8 mg / dL or 25% increase
- [ ] Potassium > 6 mmol / L or 6 mEq / L
- [ ] Phosphorus > 2.1 mmol / L or 6.5 mg / dL in children
- [ ] Phosphorus > 1.45 mmol / L or 4.5 mg / dL in adults
- [ ] Calcium < 1.75 mmol / L or 7 mg / dL

#### Clinical TLS
Lab TLS + one or more of the following:

- [ ] Increased serum creatinine concentration > 1.5 times the upper limit of normal
- [ ] Cardiac arrhythmia
- [ ] Sudden death
- [ ] Seizure

### Cairo-Bishop Severity Grading
#### 0
Creatinine

Seizure
#### 1

#### 2

#### 3

#### 4

#### 5

## Risk
* Hematologic malignancies
	* NHLs > ALL (Burkitt)
	* Targeted anticancer drugs (e.g. venetoclax, obinutuzumab)
	* High proliferation rate
	* Chemosensitivity
	* Large tumor burden > 10 cm in diameter
		* WBC > 50k
		* pretreatment LDH > 2-fold ULN
		* Organ infiltration
		* bone marrow involvement
* Pretreatment hyperuricemia
* Preexisting hephropthy
* Oliguria
* Acidic urine
* Dehydration
* Volume depletion
* Inadequate hydration during treatment

## Treatment
### Hyperuricemia
* Allopurinol
	* Prophylactic
* Rasburicase
