Dear Dr. Paladine,

I am writing to inform you that I am resigning from my position as Graduate Housestaff in the Family Medicine program for the New York-Presbyterian Hospital / Columbia University Medical Center, effective June 26th.

Thank you very much for the opportunities for professional and personal development that you have provided me during the last year. I have enjoyed working here and appreciate the support provided me during my brief tenure at this residency program.

If I can be of any help during this transition, please let me know.

Sincerely,



Kevin Hu
