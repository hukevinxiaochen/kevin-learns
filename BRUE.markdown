Definition of BRUE:

Event lasting <1 minute in an infant <1 year of age that is associated with at least one of the following: cyanosis or pallor; absent, decreased, or irregular breathing; marked change in muscle tone (hypertonia or hypotonia); altered level of responsiveness

Patient must otherwise be well-appearing and back to baseline health at the time of presentation, and, on evaluation, have no condition that could explain the event.

Criteria for designating lower risk:

- [ ] Age >60 days
- [ ] Gestational age ≥32 weeks and postconceptional age ≥45 weeks
- [ ] First BRUE
- [ ] No cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) required by trained medical provider
- [ ] No features in the history of concern (e.g., possible child abuse, family history of sudden unexplained death, toxic exposures)
- [ ] No worrisome physical exam findings (e.g., bruising, cardiac murmurs, organomegaly).

Recommendations for management of lower-risk infants (almost all are grades B or C, weak or moderate recommendations):

- [ ] Use shared decision-making with the family and offer resources for caregiver CPR training.
- [ ] Providers may obtain pertussis testing, 12-lead electrocardiogram, and a brief period of continuous pulse oximetry monitoring with serial observations.
- [ ] Providers should not order other testing or monitoring for cardiopulmonary, child abuse, neurologic, infectious disease, gastrointestinal, inborn errors of metabolism, or anemia evaluation, including home cardiorespiratory monitoring and admission solely for cardiorespiratory monitoring.
- [ ] Providers should not prescribe acid suppression therapy or antiepileptic medications.
