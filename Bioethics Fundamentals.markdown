# Bioethics Fundamentals
[[Medical Knowledge]]

## Withholding and Withdrawing Treatment (Foregoing vs Stopping)
* Ethically equivalent
* Feels different to families
## Euthanasia / Assisted Suicide
* Autonomy, allow physician aide in dying
* Obligation of providers depends on permissibility within state
## Constraints on Autonomy
* Immaturity
* Incapacity
* Ignorance
* Coercion
## Surrogate Decision Making
* Weak Autonomy Standard - substituted judgment, what the individual would want
* Pure Autonomy Standard - prior expressed autonomous judgments, e.g. advanced directive
* Best Interest Standard - highest net benefit
## Duty to Rescue v Avoiding Harm
* Condition-based futility
* Qualitative futility
* Quantitative futility
* Physiologic futility

Futility is not being able to attain a specific goal for a specific patient.
Distinguish futility from rationing.
“Potentially inappropriate” rather than “futile”

Sense of fairness

### Process for Limiting Care
Within accepted medical practice?
Publicly reviewed?
Am I biased?

### Intractable Disputes
* Offer transfer to another facility
* Inform surrogates of opportunity for extramural appeal
* Implement decision of process
