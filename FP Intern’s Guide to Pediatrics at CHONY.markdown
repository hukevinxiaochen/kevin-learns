The Pediatrics rotation during intern year is both demanding and rewarding. While you are often very busy during this rotation, especially in the winter months, it is one of the most worthwhile and most organized experiences as an intern.  CHONY is ranked in the top 4 Children’s Hospitals in the Nation and the Pediatrics residents whom you will work with are all nice, welcoming, and supportive. You are treated the same as any Pediatric intern would be, and are given the same responsibilities.

## The Team
There are 2 general pediatric teams, Team 1 and Team 2.  Your team is composed of:

* 2 senior residents (2 PGY-3s, or 1 PGY-3 and 1 PGY-2)
* 4-5 interns
* 2-3 major clinical year (MCY) students

The interns consist of:

* You
* 3 Pediatric interns
* (Optional: Anesthesia intern)
* (Optional: Sub-I)

## The Patients

Currently, both the new and old Children’s Hospitals are in use. The patients are located on Towers 4 (where most of your patients will be), 5, and 6 in the New Hospital and Babies 8S in the Old Hospital. The 2 hospitals connect on Floors 1, 3, and 9.

**Floor** patients have a Ward attending who will round on all Ward patients. These patients often belong to any one of the Columbia ACN clinics (Rangel, Broadway, 180th St., Audubon, Morgan, Farrell) or have no PMD or an outside PMD. The Ward attending also runs Attending Rounds.  Rounds occur around 9 am daily.  Be sure to see all of your patients before then.

**Special** patients may be Peds GI, Peds Liver, Peds Endocrine, Peds Heme, Peds Pulm etc. Each one of these specialty services has their own attendings who round on their kids. If you have a specialty patient, page the appropriate team to discuss the plan or ask any questions when you can in the morning. Additionally, for GI and for Liver patients, there are table rounds (GI starting at 10, in the Britney_Resident Lounge; Liver at 10:45am  in the 4 Tower Team Room; your senior will let you know.) GI patients are assigned to Team 1 and Liver patients are assigned to Team 2. You are expected to go to rounds even if you aren't taking care of any GI_Liver patients. It is a usually a great learning opportunity. You only need to go to the rounds (GI or Liver) for the team you are on.  

**Farrell** patients admitted to your service should have their PCP paged or SHM'd. They will likely come to round on the patient. However, Farrell patients are still formally managed by the Ward attending or Specialty attending whose service the patient is on. 
 
**PEDS 2000** is a General Peds practice with their own rotating attendings. Once again, your senior will tell you who to contact and how.

**GPGP** is another General Peds service – they have their own rotating Attendings as well. Ask your senior what Attending is covering.

## Your Typical Day

You will find out your schedule by logging on to AMION.com. The password is `chony`, once logged in go to the "Call" tab and look for your name. This will tell you which week you are assigned and which weekdays, 24s, or weekend days you are working. When you are on days, see below:

Monday, Tues, Thurs:
 
6:30-7:30am:  Signout from night intern. Takes place in either the Team Room or in the Resident Lounge. On your first day, if you go to the 4 Tower Team Room (right behind the front desk in 4 Tower, you can find out where it is). The Senior(s) and the day interns meet with the night intern and get signout about all the old patients. Additionally, the night float intern will present new patients from overnight with the help of the Night Senior Admitting Resident (SAR). 

7:30-8:00AM: Short amount of time to do work before morning report (8am) and wards attending rounds (9am) . If there are sick kids_respiratory kids, you may want to check on them. Or you can call urgent consults, review labs, start writing notes (especially if it's your clinic day), etc. You should try to see all of the Ward kids before rounds, but if you can't, try to have general updates_labs/results etc. for your presentation. 

8:00AM - 8:45/9AM: Mondays: Morning report Tuesdays: Board review (optional for interns) Wednesdays: Chief of Service (P&S Amphitheater 1) Thursdays: Evidence Based Medicine (Resident Lounge/the Brit) Fridays: Grand Rounds (P&S Amphitheater 1)

8:45/9AM -10:30AM: Walk rounds with Wards attending. At each patients room, the covering intern or medical student should go in and ask the family if it's okay if the entire team can come in to discuss or if they'd prefer the team talks outside. 

9:15-10am:
Every 2nd Tuesday: Slater Rounds. The team chooses a case (with some psychosocial stressor or interesting family dynamics) to discuss with Dr. Slater (child psych). Then Dr. Slater interviews the patient with the team and then debriefs with the team afterwards. First and Third Tuesdays of the rotation, Slater rounds are for Team 1; Second and Fourth are with Team 2.

10:30AM-11:45: Specialists usually round during this time.  Liver and Heme for Team 2. If Team 1, it is work time for interns. Touch base with your senior 15 minutes or so before noon to sign out any pending results/consultsbefore you go to noon conference.

11:45AM - Sign out, put Mobile heartbeat on BUSY, then attend noon conference or go to clinic

12:00-1:00 PM: Noon conference with food Monday through Thursday. You are expected to go to conference daily and will be covered by your seniors on the mobile heartbeat. Friday, bring lunch or order in.

Monday is Intern Conference with the Pediatric Residency Program Director Dr. Wedemeyer. It’s case-based and usually very good. 

1PM: Turn your Mobile Heartbeat back to "AVAILABLE" 

1:00PM-2:00PM Seniors go to Interdisciplinary rounds in Team room on 4 Tower. Work time for Interns

Afternoon: You may have radiology rounds, or teaching lead by the attending or presentations by the medical students. 

3:30-4:30pm: Update handoffs and prepare for sign out

4:30pm: Sign out to Intern on 24. By this time you should have finished notes and updated the rounded sheets on your patients. (see below).

Wednesday and Friday are a little different as you have Chief of Service (Wednesday) or Pediatric Grand Rounds (Friday) at 8:00 AM. There are attending rounds on Friday directly after Grand Rounds.

Saturday and Sunday day: Signout is again at 6:30am. One intern covers team 1 and one intern covers team 2, with a float intern each day for each team (VERY helpful for getting notes done and discharges). One senior will cover both teams. Begin your day by making a scut sheet\*, this will be crucial to organizing/prioritizing throughout the day. See your patients in the morning, then touch base with the wards attending (usually in person), and the specialty fellows (usually over the phone). They will usually call you when they're ready to talk about their patients. These are generally informal conversations about patients progress (as opposed to formal presentations). Signout to night float for team two is at 4:30pm both days. One progress notes should be written for each patient over the weekend. Saturday day, Sunday day and night float interns should all help out to make sure this happens.

Tips for weekend days and 24s:

- [ ] they are generally fast-paced and hectic, but remember that the senior is ALWAYS a phone call away. 
- [ ] make a scut sheet! in addition to the detailed handoff for each patient, print another handoff > "select all" > "create handoff report" > "format report" > change the "lines between patients" to 11, uncheck "page break between patients, uncheck everything except name / location / age / gender. (You may have to check/uncheck some fields for the text to disappear from your report) > uncheck "include cover sheet > PRINT.  For each patient, write their presenting complaint next to their name. Use the three boxes for 1. MAJOR things you want to reference quickly (correction equations for diabetics, kids who need to always be renally dosed, etc), 2. Events that occur throughout the day (be sure to note times), 3. Your to do list for each patient. 

## The Patient Load

On average, you will have around 4-5 patients that are your own. There is some cross coverage because on most afternoons, one or sometimes two interns go to clinic.

You also may be asked to admit a patient or two during the day. The Senior Admitting Resident (SAR) will write all the admission orders and will do the medication reconciliation. Sometimes they will even write the admission note for you but you must still see the patient and take over care for them.  THIS IS A FUN AND GOOD LEARNING EXPERIENCE.  The SAR is generally very relaxed and helps you through it. 

Each day there will be anywhere from 2-4 interns covering everyone on the service. Because of clinic , sometimes there are only 2 interns in the PM. Rarely, there is one intern in the PM which is demanding if you are the lucky one to be alone that day. Remember, the seniors will NEVER leave you alone. You will always have support and keep in mind that usually everyone has to be alone once during the month so the pain is equally distributed!
 
MEDICAL STUDENTS can be a valuable asset to you. The medical students usually follow around 2-3 patients. They may or may not write notes (when they do, you still have to write your own, and you should read theirs, addend and give feedback); they present whomever they are following; they can do some scut on their patients, and especially later in the year (which for them starts in January and ends in December), they can call consultants. It is important to remember that the medical student work should never be in lieu of yours. You should read their notes and know and round on their patients as you are ultimately responsible. As far as teaching the students goes, this will be dependent on you. You will find as the year goes on you may be more comfortable teaching them little tidbits. It depends on how much effort you want to put into it. 

## 24s      
You will get sign out from the rest of your team at 4:30pm, like any other day.  Create a scut sheet from the handoff reports and write down pertinent tasks_labs to review.  Review patients with whom you are not familiar. Another system for taking notes and making a scut list is to print out a senior handoff list with all the boxes under options unchecked and with 7 or 8 lines minimum between patients, so that you essentially get a list of patients with 3 large boxes beneath each name. In the first box, you can write down essential background information (12 yo boy DM1 with frequent visits for DKA, just transferred from PICU, s_p insulin drip, anion gap closed, now tolerating reg diet PO and FS in nl range); in the second, what you need to do tonight (f_u fingersticks at dinnertime, midnight and 3am; cover meals with aspart); in the third box, what you need to pass on to the next day team (discuss with SW setting up VNS; endocrine outpatient f_u).

Receive signout on all the team’s patients during signout rounds. You will only cover your team.

Prioritize who you will need to keep an eye on during the night and what scut needs to be done. See the sickest kids and those who need resp checks first, and multiple times.

Typically, if the list is small (15 patients or less) you should round on all patients on the list. Do respiratory checks for all patients needing them, see all sick kids, poke your head in on other patients so you know what they look like. If the list is long, especially in the winter when they are 20-25 patients, you will only (and can only) see who needs to be physically seen.

You will accept all admissions after signout, and unfortunately there is no cap. In the winter this is tough because you can get 8 admits in 1 night, but on average you will admit 3-4 patients per night. You admit with the Senior Admitting Resident (SAR) who puts in the orders.

The Ward Senior on call will often run the list with you at sometime during the evening and touch base with you about all the patients.

The Wards attending usually calls around 10-11pm to run the entire list with you- have updates, pertinent changes and concerns written down on your sheet.  When you're carrying 25-30 kids they can all blend together.

The specialty fellows (Liver/GI) will check in around 9-10pm, and are often available by text earlier in the evening.  They like to know ALL changes, UOP, drain output, etc. are generally very important to them- calculate these and be ready

LIVER CELL PHONE: 646-670-8063
GI CELL PHONE: 646-430-3435 

Update the handoffs for each patient, including new admits. It's best to fill out as much of the paperwork and as early in the night as possible (major events, plan for the next day, IVF_diet_O2 delivery and whatever else you don't anticipate changing). Then fill out 24hr vitals and I/O at around 5:30am.   

Print updated handoffs and cover sheet for all team members for 6:30am sign out.  It is helpful to highlight the coversheet for each intern for their patients and staple the handoffs that are multiple pages.  Be ready for 6:30am sharp sign out. Don't forget to update the CareTeam grid and give one to the Unit Assistant who sits right outside of the elevators on 4 Tower. 

SLEEPING: Unfortunately, there isn’t much of this during Peds. There are call rooms and keys which we do not have...the other interns are VERY kind and let you borrow a key whenever you need. There are 2 rooms with bunkbeds and 1 shared bathroom. Unfortunately, the call rooms are not among the perks of the new hospital; however be thankful that these call rooms don’t have the same arctic temps the old call rooms did!

DRESSING: During the week on days you should dress up (wear what you would to a Farrell clinic session). When you are on 24s or weekends you can wear scrubs. People are often split on wearing their white coat.  It is not required and most interns/all seniors did not wear them month 1 (July 2017).

How to go about doing what you have to do: 

1. ALL notes, vitals, and orders are on the ECLYPSIS system.
·        There are templates for admission notes and daily progress notes.

Hit “Signout” when in ECLYPSIS to get your 24 hr range of vitals. All vitals should be reported in ranges on Peds. Don’t forget your daily wts and I/O which are not in “Signout.”

Use Pediatric General Child Admission for Admission notes, and Pediatric General Child Resident Follow up for follow-up notes. 

All orders are in Eclypsis. Exceptions include certain lab tests (ex: certain studies for transplant work up; the Liver fellow will tell you which vials you need to obain. In these cases, put in a general nursing order, and let the nurse know. 

The paper chart is only used for a couple of reasons: Asthma Action plans (which must be done for any patient admitted for asthma or reactive airway dz; find it under letters in Eclypsis, fill it out, and print out one copy for the parents and one for the chart.), Consultant notes (I think only the pain service is still writing paper notes), records from outside institutions, EKGs before they are scanned it, etc.

2. Remember your peds guidebook. It will have the numbers of all the attendings, residents, and consultants. Often the pager numbers are easy to remember: i.e.: ID consult is pager number VANC, GI consult is pager number GUTS. We have one copy for FM so be sure to pass it along to the next intern along with the call room key!

3. Have the following numbers handy (the WARD CLERK desk numbers for each of the floors). This is how you reach the nurses.

4 Tower: 342-8500
8 South: 305-5919

To reach a nurse, the easiest way is to call the ward clerk at the number above and ask which nurse is taking care of your patient, and ask what that nurse’s ASCOM number is for the day. For 4 tower, you can grab a copy of the nurse assignments from the clerk 

4. The Peds people PRESENT BY SYSTEMS.  RESP_CV_FENGI/NEURO-PAIN, etc. 

5. There are HANDOFFS that get kept on each patient. These handoffs are your lifelines as an intern. Each day you will need to record on your handoffs what has happened with your patient, write meds, pertinent labs, etc. The handoffs are passed onto the oncall intern for the night and given to the cross cover intern during the day. It is important to KEEP THESE SHEETS UPDATED WELL. This is why cross coverage is so successful on Peds. It is also how you will able to keep track of the details on all the patients, including those that are not your own.

6. ANCILLARY SERVICES are excellent here. They are much better than they are at the Allen. The Blood techs work 24 hrs. There is an IV team from 7a-7p each day to place IV’s. If Don, the IV nurse is on, he works until 11pm. The IV team also doubles as the PICC team. Nurses often also place IV’s and NG tubes for you as well. Dorkus is a woman whose sole job is to place/adjust NG tubes. Use these people – they make your life much easier!

So this is probably all completely overwhelming, but just remember that you are never alone in all of this. While you are the only FP person in sight during your Peds months, just remember that all your FP seniors are thinking of you and wishing for the best. You can call anyone for advice or as a sounding board. The Peds residents are also a FANTASTIC group of people. They are a lot of fun and are always willing to help. They want you to have a good experience too so just keep that in mind and take the hard times in stride!  The other interns are also VERY welcoming and receptive to you joining them in everything, just stay calm and friendly and you will enjoy this month. :)
