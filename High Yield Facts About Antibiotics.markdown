_Natural Penicillins_

* The representative natural penicillins to know.

What are Penicillin G (parenteral) and V (oral)?

* The spectrum of activity of natural penicillins.

Some gram positive (Strep pyogenes, Strep agalactiae, some Strep pneumoniae), negative (Neisseria meningitidis), anaerobes (Actinomyces), and spirochetes (Treponema pallidum, Leptospira).

* The significance of the fact that nearly all bacteria have cell walls composed of peptidoglycan requiring cross linking by an enzyme known as a penicillin binding protein.

What is the reason natural penicillins affect so many different types of bacteria?

* The significance of the 6 Ps: penetration, porins, pumps, penicillinases (also known as beta-lactamases), penicillin-binding proteins with lower affinity (PBPs), and peptidoglycan (lack thereof).

What are the mechanisms of penicillin resistance, and hence the reason that so few species of bacteria remain sensitive to natural penicillins?

_Antistaphylococcal_

* The representative antistaphylococcal antibiotics to know.

What are oxacillin (parenteral), dicloxacillin (oral), and methicillin (not used, but gives rise to name methicillin-resistant Staph aureus - MRSA)?

* The reason all Staphylococci have been resistant to natural penicillins since 1940s and 50s.

What are Staphylococcal beta-lactamases/penicillinases?

* The reason antistaphylococcal penicillins work against Staphylococcus.

What is a bulky sidechain that prevents binding and degradation by Staphylococcal beta-lactamases?

* The reason MRSA is resistant to even the antistaphylococcal penicillins.

What is PBP2’ - an evolved penicillin binding protein (PBP) lacking affinity for all beta-lactams?

_Aminopenicillins_

* The representative aminopenicillins to know.

What are ampicillin (Parenteral) and amoxicillin (Oral)?

* The selective channel-like structures present within the outer lipid membrane of all gram negatives except for Neisseria (which has a polysaccharide capsule remember?), through which natural penicillins have little penetrance, hence the reason most gram negatives are resistant to natural penicillins.

What are porins?

* Significance of modifying natural penicillin with hydrophilic amine-containing side chains to produce an aminopenicillin.

What is the reason aminopenicillins can pass through porins, and act on some gram negative bacteria?

* The bacterial species with especially selective porins such that even aminopenicillins have a hard time penetrating into it.

What is Pseudomonas aeruginosa?

* The significance of gram negative beta lactamases, e.g. TEM-1 beta-lactamases produced by members of the Enterobacteriaceae family (E coli, Klebsiella)?

What is the reason aminopenicillins cannot be broadly effective against all gram negatives?

* Listeria monocytogenes - one of the most common causes of meningitis in newborns - has a special PBP that resists cephalosporins.

What is the reason that one must use a penicillin like ampicillin to treat Listeria?

* Despite being mostly an intracellular pathogen, Listeria monocytogenes is mostly extracellular in the meninges and CSF. So what?

What is the reason Ampicillin still works in Listeria meningitis despite its poor penetration into human cells.

* Ampicillin is only bacteriostatic against Listeria. Small amounts of gentamicin work synergistically with Ampicillin to provide true bactericidal power.

What is the reason gentamicin is combined with ampicillin for Listeria meningitis treatment?

* In cases of acute otitis media - despite a large percentage of Streptococcus pneumoniae possessing PBPs with low affinity for amoxicillin and natural penicillins, and gram negative Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis possessing beta-lactamases that degrade amoxicillin, amoxicillin is still used to treat this infection, albeit in high doses.

What is the significance of the observation that high enough doses of ampicillin can pretty much overwhelm bacterial resistance mechanisms?

_Aminopenicillin and Beta-Lactamase Inhibitor Combinations_

* The combo aminopenicillins + beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations to know.

What are Amoxicillin and Clavulanate (brand name: Augmentin) and Ampicillin and Sulbactam (brand name: Unasyn)?

What are periodontal disease, intra-abdominal abscesses, pulmonary diseases (especially in association with possible aspiration), and pelvic inflammatory disease?

_Extended-Spectrum Penicillins_

* The extended spectrum penicillins to know.

What are piperacillin and ticarcillin?

* Some gram negatives, such as Pseudomonas, have outer cell membranes that are difficult to translocate across and anything that wishes to get across mostly likely needs to pass through a porin. Ampicillin doesn’t seem to cut it.

What is the reason extended spectrum penicillins were developed?

* Retained activity against gram positives other than MRSA, resistance to degradation by many gram negative beta-lactamases, and better translocation across gram negative cell envelopes.

What is the reason extended spectrum penicillins combined with a beta-lactamase inhibitor can be active against gram positives, anaerobic bacteria, and nearly all gram negative bacteria - thereby making it one of the broadest spectrum antibiotics in existence (e.g. piperacillin-tazobactam) ?

**Cephalosporins**

What is 5?

* The pattern of the coverage with successive generations of cephalosporins.

What is more gram negative coverage?

_1st Gen_

* The 1st generation cephalosporins to know.

What are cefazolin and cephalexin (brand name Keflex)?

* Antistaphylococcal penicillins only cover Staphylococcus. Staphylococcus is resistant to natural penicillins and often to aminopenicillins and even extended spectrum agents. First generation cephalosporins, however, are resistant to Staphylococcal beta-lactamases.

What is the reason first generation cephalosporins are discussed a lot in cases of cellulitis, when coverage for both Staphylococcus and Streptococcus is important?

* While first generation cephalosporins are resistant to cleavage by Staphylococcal beta-lactamases, this does not carry over to gram negative beta-lactamases.

* The glycopeptide antibiotic to know.

What is vancomycin?

* The significance of the fact that glycopeptides are relatively large molecules.

What is the reason  glycopeptides cannot pass through the porins of gram negative bacteria?

* The reason glycopeptides are poorly absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract and must be given IV for systemic treatments.

What is the fact that glycopeptides are very large molecules?

* The coverage profile of glycopeptides like vancomycin.

What are all gram positives except for some enterococci (VRE) and Listeria monocytogenes?

* The reason antibiotics like doxycycline or gentamicin or TMP/SMX are rarely first-line medications (e.g. MRSA, UTI).

What are serious side effects such as tooth discoloration, hearing loss, or renal damage?

* A theory as to why antibiotics that work by either inhibiting protein synthesis or inhibiting DNA synthesis are so prone to adverse effects?

What is the notion that DNA and protein synthesis inhibition processes are highly conserved between life forms leading to a “friendly fire” effect?
