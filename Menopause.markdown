## Physiology
* Menopause - single point in time
* Menopausal transition - perimenopasual, until menopause
* Postmenopause - after menopause
* Premature ovarian failure - before age of 40
* FSH may be markedly elevated
* Increased risk of endometrial hyperplasia and cancer during menopausal transition
* Vasomotor (hot flashes, night sweats)
	* 70% of women report hot flashes
	* May be related to hypothalamic variations in response to falling estrogen
		* basal body temperature rises
		* sweating happens in response
		* body cools down, i.e. chills
* Bone density drop in response to increased osteoclastic activity in absence of estrogen

## Common Concerns and Symptoms
* Vasomotor (hot flashes, night sweats)
	* 70% of women
* Vaginal dryness and dyspareunia
* Symptoms vary by cultural context
* Hormone Replacement Therapy is indicated for treatment of hot flashes. (AAFP)
	* Does increase risk of breast cancer slightly
	* Does increase risk of stroke and VTE
	* 3-5 years
	* Taper off
* Hormone Replacement Therapy helps a very little bit with dyspareunia (Cochrane Review)
* HRT does not help with urinary incontinence and may worsen it
* Genitourinary symptoms such as thinning of vulvar mucosa can cause pruritus, burning, dyspareunia
	* Non-hormonal moisturizers help
	* Then try intravaginal estrogens
	* Less than 1 year does not require progestin
	* Ospemifene is an estrogen agonist-antagonist

## Healthcare Maintenance
* Primary causes of illness in women after 50
	* Coronary artery disease
		* Statin at 7.5%
			* Can stop after 75
		* Aspirin at 10%
			* Can stop after age 69
	* Breast Cancer
	* Cervical cancer
	* Ovarian cancer
		* Nothing you can do
	* Osteoporosis
		* FRAX 9.3% is reason to do bone density testing
	* Depression
		* HITS questionnaire (hurting, insult, threaten, scream)
		* CAGE questions for alcohol
		* NIAA levels for elevated consumption > 7 drinks per week for women
	* STI rates rival adolescents
		* Screen for STIs
