## News
08/03/2018 - Dr Modi has requested that you request ‘Rehabilitation Service Consultation’ rather than a PT evaluation alone. This is to ensure patients have a full assessment and are recommended the optimal treatment. Please enter this in addition to a PT evaluation to ensure the patients get the benefit of early PT evaluation/treatment and the management recommendation of a physiatrist.
