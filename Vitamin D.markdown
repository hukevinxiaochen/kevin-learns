## Basics

### Roles and Terms
* Physiologic role of Vitamin D is to **promote mineralization of new bone**.
* Its effects lead to measurable increases in Ca2+ and Phosphate concentrations in plasma.
* Vitamin D is considered a hormone and like other hormones its metabolism ends up being important:
	* Skin + UV light produces Cholecalciferol
	* Cholecalciferol is also a frequently ingested form of Vitamin D
	* Hepatic processing yields 25-OH-Cholecalciferol
	* Renal processing yields active hormone 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol a.k.a. calcitriol.
		* Enzyme here is 1-alpha-hydroxylase
		* 1-alpha hydroxylase activity is responsive to declining serum ionized calcium concentrations, increased PTH, and declining serum phosphate levels
### Actions
* In the **intestine** active hormone 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol induces synthesis Ca2+-binding protein **calbindin D-28 K**
* In the **kidney** 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol promotes reabsorption of both Phosphate and Ca2+
* In the **bone** 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol acts synergistically with PTH to stimulate osteoclast activity and bone resorption. The notion here is that old bone is what gets resorbed and Ca2+ and Phosphate are mobilized so that they can redeposit on new bone.

### Pathophysiology
* We know that Vitamin D deficiency in children can lead to **Rickets**
* In **rickets** deficiency of Vitamin D leads to there not being enough mobilized Ca2+ and Phosphate to mineralize growing bones. This manifests with:
	* Growth failure
	* Skeletal deformities
* In adults, Vitamin D deficiency can lead to **osteomalacia**. Here, new bone also fails to mineralize which can manifest as:
	* bending and softening of weight-bearing bones
