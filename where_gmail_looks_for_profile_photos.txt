Hi Ruth,

There are 5 different places where Gmail could be referencing for your profile picture:
In Gmail's Settings
Gmail>>Settings>>"My Picture"
In your Google+ profile
Google+>>View your Profile
Via your contacts
Search for yourself by email address and see what photo appears.
If you have a "Send as" address that is treated as an alias, Gmail would reference the profile photo used for that Google account.
Via another app or mail program, like Apple mail or Outlook. 
If you have your profile photo attached to your own contact in one of those program's address books, be sure to change it.
If you go through each one of these and you still can't find the photo, try waiting 24 hours for the changes to take effect.
