## Definition
### DSM V
Disturbance in attention and awareness
Short period of time
Fluctuates
Cognition disturbed too
**NOT EXPLAINED BY** preexisting, evolving, or established neurocognitive disorder, and not in context of reduced arousal (e.g. coma)

### Aliases
Acute confusional state
Encephalopathy

## Diagnose
Diagnose delirium in patients with **inattention** that has an **acute onset** and **fluctuating course** with either **disorganized thinking** or **altered level of consciousness**.

_Inattention_ - "Did the patient have difficulty focusing attention, for example, being easily distractible or having difficulty keeping track of what was being said?"
_Acute onset_ - according to a family member or nurse, “Is there evidence of an acute change in mental status from baseline?”
_Fluctuating course_ - “Does it come and go?”
_Disorganized thinking_ - "Was the patient's thinking disorganized or incoherent, such as rambling or irrelevant conversation, unclear or illogical flow of ideas, or unpredictable switching from subject to subject?"
_Altered level of consciousness_ - Hyper-alert=vigilant, Drowsy but easily aroused=lethargic, Difficult to arouse=stupor, Unarousable=coma

## Differential
**Sundowning** - phenomenon of behavioral deterioration seen in evening hours in demented, institutionalized patients; established sundowning and no obvious medical illness may be suffering effects of impaired circadian regulation or nocturnal factors in the institutional environment; new sundowning is delirium

**Focal Syndrome**
	* Temporal Parietal - Wernicke’s aphasia restricted to language, Transient Global Amnesia also possible in bitemporal disease
	* Occipital - Anton’s syndrome of cortical blindness and confabulation
	* Frontal - akinetic mutism, lack of spontaneity, lack of judgment, problems with working or recent memory, 
CVA is prevalent in cases of acute mental status changes

**Nonconvulsive Status Epilepticus**
**Dementia** fluctuations of hallucinations in DLB are common
**Primary Psychiatric Illness** 

## Management
### Testing
* Think about electrolytes and important metabolites: BMP, ABG
* Infection: CBC, Culture of Blood and Urine, CXR
* Drugs: Get levels if seems reasonable
* LFTs, B12, TSH as indicated
* Neuroimaging is necessary if there is no obvious cause
* Lumbar puncture is necessary if there is no obvious cause
* EEG may be considered if there is no obvious cause
