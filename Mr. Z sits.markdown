Mr. Número Uno of the Hundred-Most-Common surnames in China sits on a bench with about 4 yellowed teeth staring contentedly into the distance in Huangchenggenyizhi (皇城根遗址公园) Park. He’s been here in Beijing 4 years and comes from Hubei. He’s here to take care of his grandson.

I’m sitting here in a coffee shop. The furniture is all rectangular, wood, a buttery color, smooth in texture, but you can feel the tree rings. Outside the floor-to-ceiling window I can see a young woman in fashionable faux fur coat lighting up a smoke with a black-bodied gold-capped lighter. Battered tricycles for carrying all kinds of knick knacks sit on the side of the road. I’m just outside a famous tourist destination: a collection of Beijing’s old alleys stuffed with souvenir stores and churro vendors and hostels for foreigners. Wealthy youths trendier than thou trot along, dip into this coffee shop called Voyage, Apple laptops all a clickity-clacking away; my server brings me freshly ground single origin “Red Cherry” coffee in a cocktail shaker and asks me to take a whiff to see if the aroma is to my liking. Claro que si.
