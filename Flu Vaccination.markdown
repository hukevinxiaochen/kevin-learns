## When does protective immunity develop following administration of the influenza vaccination?
“Protective immunity doesn't develop until 1–2 weeks after vaccination.”

## Why might someone feel like they “got the flu” after having received the injectable vaccine?
“Some people who get vaccinated later in the season (December or later) may be infected with influenza virus shortly afterward (see _When does protective immunity develop following administration of the influenza vaccination?_). These late vaccine recipients develop influenza because they were exposed to someone with the virus before they became immune. It is not the result of the vaccination.”

“Less than 1% of people who are vaccinated with the injectable vaccine develop flu-like symptoms, such as mild fever and muscle aches, after vaccination. These side effects are not the same as having influenza, but people confuse the symptoms.”

“To many people ‘the flu’ is any illness with fever and cold symptoms or gastrointestinal symptoms. If they get any viral illness, they may blame it on the vaccine or think they got "the flu" despite being vaccinated. Influenza vaccine only protects against certain influenza viruses, not all viruses.“

”The influenza vaccine is not 100% effective, especially in older persons.“
