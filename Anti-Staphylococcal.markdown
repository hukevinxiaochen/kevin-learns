## Drugs
Oxacillin, Nafcillin (IV)
Dicloxacillin (oral)
Methicillin (back in the day)

## Chemistry
R group is bulkier hydrophobic bicyclic aromatic

## Coverage
MSSA - its beta-lactamase cannot bind the bulkier penicillin

## Resistant
* Chlamydia and mycoplasma have no peptidoglycan.
* E. coli, Shigella, and Proteus and most gram negatives all have porins that especially do not traffic bulky hydrophobic natural penicillin.
* Other gram positives like MRSA and Enterococcus and Streptococcus just donâ€™t bind this beta-lactam with high affinity.
