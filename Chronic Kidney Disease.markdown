e.g.

* anatomic abnormalities on imagine
* biopsy abnormalities
* history of kidney transplanation

### Decreased function
* eGFR using serum creatinine and one of several available equations < 60 mL/min per 1.73 m^2

@NYP, the eGFR is calculated using MDRD
@NYP, the CrCl is calculated using a flawed Cockroft-Gault calculator - DO NOT USE

## Classification
### Purpose
* Risk stratify

* GFR (G stage)
* Albuminuria (A stage)

### Classes
