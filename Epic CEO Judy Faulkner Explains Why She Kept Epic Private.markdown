Judy Faulkner launched Epic in 1979 with a $70,000 bank loan.

Big customers include Kaiser, Cleveland Clinic, Johns Hopkins, and CVS Health.

It is built on the MUMPS programming language. Epic uses Cache, a proprietary upgrade of MUMPS, developed by Intersystems in Cambridge, Mass.

She worked with Dr. Warner Slack.

Epic got started doing on-call schedules. Then John Greist asked Judy to build something that would keep track of time series data that could be easily customized and composed into data screens.
