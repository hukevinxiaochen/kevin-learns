## Staphylococcus
Skin and Soft Tissue
Osteomyelitis
Bacteremia
Endocarditis
Pneumonia

Intrinsically resistant to old-fashioned penicillin.

## Strep Pneumo
Otitis media
Sinusitis
Meningitis
CAP

## Streptococci
Skin and soft tissue

## Enterococcus
Normal intestinal flora
Gram positive cocci in chains
Reaction to group D antiserum
Humans grow faecalis and faecium
Intrinsically resistant to beta-lactams because they contain penicillin-binding proteins

## Listeria
Widespread in nature and soil and fecal flora that takes advantage of the very young, very old, and pregnant

Weirdly, ampicillin is particular good and acts synergistically with gentamicin in CSF.

Listeria’s PBPs do not bind to cephalosporins — weird.

## Enterobacteraciae
E coli, Klebsiella, and Proteus

Bacteremia
CAP
Wound infections
Intra-abdominal and gastroenteritis
UTI

## Pseudomonas
In the immunocompromised


## Neisseria
Gonorrhea and meningitis
Ceftriaxone achieves high levels in CSF
Usually penicillin sensitive

## Haemophilus influenza
See Strep Pneumo
Has beta-lactamase so need the beta-lactamase inhibitors

## Anaerobic gram negative bacilli
Seems like they are uniformly susceptible to beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor combos, carbapenems, and metronidazole

Mouth, GI, vagina

Aspiration
Peridontal disease
Intra-abdominal abscesses
PID

## Chlamydia
Interesting intracellulaar biphasic life
Need antibiotics that penetrate into ells (macrolides, tetracyclines)

## Mycoplasma
Smallest known free-living organisms
See Chlamydia for Tx
