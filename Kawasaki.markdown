## Epidemiology
6 months to 5 years
Incidence 10 in 100,000 in US
Japanese ancestry
Boys more than girls

## Pathophysiology
Medium-sized vasculitis
Process leads to narrowing lumen
Abnormal flow can lead to coronary artery aneurysms in setting of acute necrotic process
Can also lead to thrombus formation
This can lead to myocardial infarction
Gallbladder hydrops

Coronary artery aneurysms account for 5% of ACS under age 40

## Diagnosis
### Classical
Rash - erythroderma, erythema multiforme
Mucosal - lips, oropharynx
Extremities - desquamation, edema
Adenopathy - cervical

### Atypical
2 or 3 of typical criteria
Elevated CRP or ESR or positive Echo

## Definition
* Fever at least 5 days

4 or more of the following:

* Conjunctivitis
* Rash - polymorphous (maculopapular, erythema multiform)
* Peripheral extremity changes - Edema of hands and feet
* Mucous membrane changes - Strawberry tongue, redness, cracking of lips 
* Cervical adenopathy

## Treatment
Will self-resolve, but treat to prevent coronary artery damage
* IVIG within first 10 days
* Anti-platelet therapy (high-dose aspirin 100 mg_kg_day until 48-72 hours post-fever), then switch to low-dose regimen 6-8 weeks
* Presence of coronary artery aneurysm is indication for low-dose aspirin continued indefinitely
## Complications
Z-score is for degree of coronary artery aneurysm
