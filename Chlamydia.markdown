## Follow Up
Test-of-cure to detect therapeutic failure (i.e., repeat testing 3â€“4 weeks after completing therapy) is not advised for persons treated with the recommended or alterative regimens, unless therapeutic adherence is in question, symptoms persist, or reinfection is suspected. Moreover, the use of chlamydial NAATs at <3 weeks after completion of therapy is not recommended because the continued presence of nonviable organisms (/ , / [394,395](https://www.cdc.gov/std/tg2015/references.htm#394)  [519](https://www.cdc.gov/std/tg2015/references.htm#519) ) can lead to false-positive results.
A high prevalence of _C. trachomatis_ infection has been observed in women and men who were treated for chlamydial infection during the preceding several months (/ , / [480,481](https://www.cdc.gov/std/tg2015/references.htm#480)  [520-522](https://www.cdc.gov/std/tg2015/references.htm#520) ). Most post-treatment infections do not result from treatment failure, but rather from reinfection caused by failure of sex partners to receive treatment or the initiation of sexual activity with a new infected partner, indicating a need for improved education and treatment of sex partners. Repeat infections confer an elevated risk for PID and other complications in women. Men and women who have been treated for chlamydia should be retested approximately 3 months after treatment, regardless of whether they believe that their sex partners were treated ( [480,481](https://www.cdc.gov/std/tg2015/references.htm#480) ). If retesting at 3 months is not possible, clinicians should retest whenever persons next present for medical care in the 12-month period following initial treatment.
