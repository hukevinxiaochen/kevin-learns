# Torsion
#learning/surgery

## Torsion
* Differential of acute scrotal pain
* It is never wrong to explore a scrotum in fear of torsion (manage like an appendicitis)
* When the ultrasound is not helpful
* The goal is to untwist the testicle to the ipsilateral side
* Fix using non absorbable proline to the Dartos fascia
* Approach to nut pain
* Scrotal ultrasound is almost never wrong

## Colovesicular Fistula
* Signs and symptoms
* Not always obvious on cystoscopy
* Radiologic techniques
* Underlying pathology is usually colorectal
* Loading the boat/expanding the team never hurts
* How to repair bladder
	- [ ] Pinholes don't need to be repaired
	- [ ] Excise entire fistula tract, then prioritize only colorectal issues 

## Urinary Retention
* Options
* Men versus women
* Fill and pull technique
* Patients with underlying disease unmasking - set the stage for longer workup.

## Trauma
* Retrograde urethrogram technique
* Easiest way to expose the kidney - avoid going in first, IR is important

## Ureteral Injury
* How to identify
* Not an emergency
* Dissect both ends
* Spatulation versus Implant
	- [ ] Double J stent
* Check the other ureter
* Where the ureters are
* Heads up yo/Load the boat

No experiences are invaluable or unnecessary.

Have a life. Pay attention to your family. Live every day like it's short.
