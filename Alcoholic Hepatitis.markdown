### Differential Diagnosis
- [ ] Acetaminophen toxicity
- [ ] Other drug-induced liver injury
- [ ] Other toxin-induced (mushrooms, carbon tetrachloride)
- [ ] Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis
- [ ] Acute viral (EBV, CMV, HSV, Hep A, B, C, D, E)
- [ ] Ischemic
- [ ] Budd-Chiari
- [ ] HELLP
- [ ] Acute fatty liver of pregnancy
- [ ] Wilson
- [ ] Autoimmune
- [ ] A1AT deficiency
- [ ] Also consider muscle breakdown, thyroiditis, celiac disease, adrenal insufficiency, and anorexia nervosa as reasons for transaminase elevation.

### Diagnosis
Clinical and laboratory features are often adequate for establishing the diagnosis of alcoholic hepatitis in a patient with:
- [ ] a long history of heavy alcohol use (typically >100 g per day for more than 20 years) provided the patient **DOES NOT**
	- [ ] have risk factors for other causes of acute hepatitis **AND**
	- [ ] testing for other common causes of hepatitis is negative.
	- [ ] Anti-hepatitis A IgM
	- [ ] Hepatitis B surface antigen, anti-hepatitis B core IgM
	- [ ] Anti-hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibodies, hepatitis C RNA
	- [ ] Biliary obstruction or Budd-Chiari syndrome using transabdominal ultrasound with Doppler
- [ ] jaundice
- [ ] moderately elevated aminotransferases (typically <300 int. unit_mL and rarely higher than 500 int. unit_mL)
- [ ] an AST:ALT ratio â‰¥2
- [ ] an elevated serum bilirubin (>5 mg_dL or 86 micromol_L)
- [ ] and an elevated INR.

Fever and leukocytosis support the diagnosis.

### Treatments
* Steroids for DF > 32
	* Consider not starting in those who are unlikely to follow up
	* Monitor for infection, GI bleed, glucose intolerance
	* Prednisolone - active ingredient, hepatic conversion from prednisone
	* 28 days
	* 16-day Taper (30 x 4, 20 x 4, 10 x 4, 5 x 3, 0 x 1)
	* Stop after 1 week in patients who fail to improve DF or Bili
