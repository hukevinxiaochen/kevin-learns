* Polymyxin, i.e. Colistin

### Beta-Lactams
All of these antibiotics inhibit cell wall synthesis at the level of the penicillin binding proteins, ie the enzymes that crosslink peptidoglycan polymers. The thought is that the beta-lactam ring occupies the D-alanyl-D-alanine binding site as a competitive inhibitor. Ultimately, disruption of the peptidoglycan matrix leaves the bacterium without means to stabilize itself against osmotic forces resulting in bacterial lysis.

Armed with this knowledge we can easily understand how some organisms may be resistant to the effects of a beta-lactam:

* Intracellular life - living behind human cell membranes, which are generally poorly permeable to beta-lactams is a good way to be “resistant.” e.g. Legionella, Rickettsia, Chlamydia
* No peptidoglycan cell wall - bugs like mycoplasma, and chlamydia just don’t depend on a peptidoglycan cell wall to survive. “Live by the cell wall, die by the cell wall. Or not - as the case may be.”
* Porins - the gatekeeping channels distributed throughout the gram negative outer membrane. Some beta lactamos can get through. Others can’t. This leads to some diverse resistance profiles for different members of this diverse family. e.g. gram negatives in general, Pseudomonas especially
* Efflux Pumps - penicillin becomes penicill-out. e.g. Pseudomonas
* Beta-lactamases - you name it, Mother Nature has an “-ase” for it. All kinds of variations here too. Again, many nuances of resistance come from this phenomenon. e.g. Staphylococcus aureus
* Low affinity Penicillin Binding Proteins - crosslink cell wall without a pocket that binds beta-lactams. Easy. e.g. Streptococcus pneumoniae

With that said, it is now time to get acquainted with our beta-lactams:

#### Penicillins

All of the penicillins derive from the following chemistry:

* Beta-lactam ring fused with 5-member thiazolidine ring
* R group

This, together with beta-lactamases, provide enough degrees of freedom to give antibiotics that cover just one organism subtype to some of the broadest coverage in existence.

No penicillin works on atypical organisms that live intracellularly or lack peptidoglycan membranes. The rest are fair game.

## Inhibitors of Protein Synthesis
The fact that antibiotics that work by the latter mechanisms tend to have more damaging side effects can be remembered by recalling that whereas cell wall synthesis is a unique feature of bacterial biology compared to their human hosts - protein synthesis and DNA replication processes are relatively conserved processes. Agents that affect bacterial protein synthesis and/or DNA replication are much more likely to also impact human cells, at least in theory - don’t ask me if this is true. This translates into clinical practice because you will notice that antibiotics like gentamicin or doxycycline are rarely first line.
