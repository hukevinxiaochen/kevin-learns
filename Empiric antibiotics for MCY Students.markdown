## Goal
1. Recognize the most commonly encountered clinical scenarios in which one might need to choose antibiotics in pediatrics.
2. Outline the required knowledge for making rational antibiotic choices.

## Objectives
_Take 45 minutes of your time_

1. Buffer (5 min)
2. Outline the common pathogens, and empiric antimicrobial choices for 5 common clinical scenarios: Fever without a source, Suspected bacteremia, Genitourinary infection, Cellulitis, Community-acquired Pneumonia, Acute otitis media. (30 min)
3. Introduce to resources required to determine correct antibiotic coverage: Empiric Antimicrobial Use Guidelines, Antibiogram, Infectious Disease consultation, IDSA, AAP. (5 min)
4. Contextualize knowledge concerning antibiotic pharmacology, microbiology, and clinical disease entities to create a foundation for future learning. (5 min)
5. Discuss bonus cases if we’re really on top things: pharyngitis, meningitis, hospital-acquired pneumonia, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, surgical site infection, osteomyelitis

## Common Clinical Scenarios
### Meningitis/Fever without a source in a neonates and infants

Factors that bear on antibiotic choice:

* Must use bactericidal agents because CSF is often without antibodies and without complement.
* Must use agents that penetrate well into CSF and at sufficient dosages.

**Pathogens**

By age group

_0-90 days_

* Streptococcus agalactiae (Group B)
* Escherichia coli
* Listeria monocytogenes

Because of maternal genitourinary flora

Also cover for:

* Herpes simplex virus

_Everyone else_
* Streptococcus pneumoniae
* Neisseria meningitidis

**Antibiotics of Choice**

* Streptococcus pneumoniae
	* 3rd-gen ceph + Vancomycin because of growing Streptococcus pneumoniae resistance via the PBP mechanism, which must be overcome by the power of vancomycin. 3rd-gen cephs can reach sufficient levels to overpower Streptococcus pneumoniae in the lungs, but not so much in the CSF.
* Streptococcus agalactiae:
	* Ampicillin + Gentamicin for synergistic effect
* For Listeria: 
	* Ampicillin (neither cephalosporins nor vancomycin work) + Gentamicin for synergistic effect
* Escherichia coli and other GNR
	* Ampicillin or 3rd-gen ceph because of increasing resistance to Amp
* Herpes simplex virus
	* Acyclovir if lethargy, neurologic symptoms, vesicular rash

### Catheter-related or Wound-related or Bloodstream infections in general

**Pathogens**
Skin flora that migrate down

* Coagulase negative Staphylococcus
* Staphylococcus aureus

More so in the immunocompromised and severely ill…
* Gram negative rods
* Pseudomonas

**Antibiotics of Choice**
* Coagulase negative Staphylococcus - often resistant to penicillin and antistaphylococcal penicillins, so vancomycin
* Staphylococcus aureus - vancomycin or antistaphylococcal penicillin depending on local MRSA prevalence/MRSA suspicion
	* MRSA produces a PBP2’ that does not bind any beta-lactam antibiotic
* Gram negative rods - 3rd gen cephalosporin or 4th gen cephalosporin (cefepime)
* Pseudomonas - 4th gen cephalosporin because membrane is impermeable except for porins and has many efflux pumps. It also has an inducible beta-lactamase that only cefepime can both penetrate and resist. Piperacillin also happens to have good ability to penetrate through porins.

### Genitourinary infection
**Pathogens**

Escherichia coli
Staphylococcus saprophytic
Proteus
Klebsiella

_Complicated?_

Serratia
Pseudomonas
Enterobacter
Citrobacter

**Antibiotics of Choice**

Uncomplicated cystitis/GNR UTI - Nitrofurantoin (achieves high concentrations in urine) because it has activity against all common UTI organisms and resistance is rare
TMP/SMX used to be used but resistance makes it less reliable these days

Uncomplicated pyelonephritis/GNR UTI - Other antibiotics that cover gram negatives because presence of bacteremia is more likely. Quinolones, 3rd-gen ceps, ahminoglycosides, ES penicillins

Complicated UTI - anti-Pseudomonal (like Cefepime)

### Cellulitis

**Pathogens**
Staphylococcus
Streptococcus pyogenes

**Antibiotics of Choice**
Staphylococcus - 1st-gen cephalosporins, anti staphylococcal penicillins; vancomycin, TMP/SMX, ceftaroline (5th gen), for MRSA
Streptococcus pyogenes - 1st-gen cephalosporins, penicillins

### Community-acquired pneumonia

**Pathogens**
Streptococcus pneumoniae and penicillin-resistant strains thereof
Haemophilus influenzae

_Rare_
Gram negatives
Staphylococcus aureus

_Atypical_
Mycoplasma
Chlamydia

**Antibiotics of Choice in Infants and Children Older Than 3 Months of Age**

* Pre-school aged children with CAP: None because viral pathogens are responsible for majority of clinical disease
* Infants and pre-school aged children, appropriately immunized, with suspected bacterial pneumonia should be treated with Amoxicillin, appropriate coverage for S. pneumoniae.

* Adults, we tend to empirically cover for atypical pathogens
	* Mild - macrolide or if risk factors/comorbidities give quinolone instead or add high-dose beta-lactam to cover S. pneumoniae 
	* Moderate - as above with risk factors, consider 3rd-gen cephalosporin
	* Severe - definitely 3rd-gen cephalosporin plus macrolide or levofloxacin
	* Pseudomonas? - two anti-pseudomonal agents (e.g. pip-tazo + cefepime)
	* MRSA? - add vancomycin

### Acute otitis media

**Pathogens**

Penicillin-resistant respiratory bugs S pneumoniae, H flu, Moraxella

**Antibiotics of Choice**

For all of these, very high doses of amoxicillin
If truly resistant, probably via beta-lactamase mechanism throw in clavulanate
If allergic response mild, go for 3rd-gen cephalosporins like cefuroxime, cefpodoxime, and cefdinir (oral)
If allergic response severe, go for macrolides like azithromycin - though not the best
