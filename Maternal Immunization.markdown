## Why Tdap?
[Tdap vaccination during pregnancy to reduce pertussis infection in young infants](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3653651/)
[Tdap Vaccine During Pregnancy Reduces Newborn Pertussis](https://www.aafp.org/news/health-of-the-public/20171010pregtdapstudy.html)

### But…
There is an absurdly high NNT.
[Protecting infants from pertussis](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3922557/)
[The number needed to vaccinate to prevent infant pertussis hospitalization and death through parent cocoon immunization.  - PubMed - NCBI](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22156850)
[Pregnancy dose Tdap and postpartum cocooning to prevent infant pertussis: a decision analysis.  - PubMed - NCBI](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23713104/)

## Food for thought
Why not remove provide PPSV23 vaccine too (if we’re doing Tdap)? [Pneumococcal vaccination during pregnancy for preventing infant infection | Cochrane](http://www.cochrane.org/CD004903/PREG_pneumococcal-vaccination-during-pregnancy-for-preventing-infant-infection)
See the NNT or NNV for Influenza vaccination [Beigi Maternal Immunization 2012](http://www.nfid.org/newsroom/news-conferences/2012-news-conferences/duma2012/beigi-presentation.pdf)
