“Park et al. (8) found that a “medically unexplained pain symptom” specifically increased suicide risk even when co-occurring with another psychiatric illness. In another study of primary care patients, 37% of those with somatoform disorders endorsed any suicidality compared with 7% of those without somatoform disorders. Furthermore, at follow up, 28% of those with somatoform pain disorder endorsed active suicidal ideation. Eighteen percent of these patients had attempted suicide in the past, and 80% of those who had attempted suicide did so within 6 months of the onset of symptoms.”
