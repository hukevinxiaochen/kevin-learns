## Management
Because our goal is to correct acidosis and volume replete without precipitating fluid shifts that cause cerebral edema.

Studies on risk factors for cerebral edema in DKA therapy suggest that overly rapid drop in plasma osmolality - 9 versus 1-2 per kg at 4 hours following initiation of fluids and insulin - may be detrimental. So is using bicarbonate. So don’t use bicarbonate.

### Fluids
Start with isotonic fluids and insulin, but don’t go too quickly.
### K repletion
### Insulin
Initial dose, 0.1 U per kg per hr
IV

### Bicarbonate for pH correction
Don’t use it in DKA. Rarely used because of side effects and minimal acceleration of pH correction of acidosis:
### Phosphate repletion
Rarely done because people rarely run low on phosphate or have trouble replacing it. Long periods of severe illness may lead to need for phosphate repletion.

* hypokalemia
* paradoxical CNS acidosis

## Complications
### Cerebral Edema
* Most frequent serious adverse event (1% of pediatric DKA episodes)
* Mortality of 25%
* No treatment
