For patients in whom combined T4 and T3 therapy is pursued, the T4 and T3 components should be prescribed as separate levothyroxine and liothyronine pills according to the above conversions, which provide T4:T3 in a dose ratio that approximates normal physiology. Refer to UpToDate topic on treatment of primary hypothyroidism in adults for details, including patient selection considerations.

T4: levothyroxine; T3: liothyronine.

Commercially available T4-T3 combination pills (liotrix) are a 4:1 ratio mixture that deliver a supraphysiologic T3 dose relative to T4 and are not suitable for providing a T4:T3 dose ratio that approximates the physiologic ratio shown in this table.
