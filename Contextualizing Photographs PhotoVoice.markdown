We see an adjacent rooftop through the East-facing window against the morning sun coming in through my window. I'm getting ready to go out on a run.

We a see a sign about how it is against the law to throw trash on the streets over a heap of trash on the street. I am visiting this neighborhood.

We see a citrus fruit surrounded by its peel in one piece held in the hand of this photographer with the scene of the mercado in the background in a neighborhood whose name this photographer does not know located in la Rep√∫blica Dominicana. I am thinking of my love, my wife, my Erica, and how I want her to see this photo so that she knows I love her, that I'll never stop thinking of her.
