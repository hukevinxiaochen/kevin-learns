#learning/dermatology

## Etiology
* 80-90% idiopathic
* physical stimuli
* NSAIDs
* stress
* systemic disorders (e.g. autoimmune disease, vasculitis)

## Differential
* hereditary angioedema comes with NO urticarial lesions - only face, hand, buttock swelling resulting from mast cell activation in deep dermal and subcutaneous tissues

## Presentation
* Episodic
* Well-circumscribed and raised erythematous plaques with central pallor
* Oval, round, or serpiginous
* Intense pruritus
* 40% may have associated angioedema
* Self resolve

## Treatment
* 2nd Generation H1 blocker (e.g. Loratadine, Cetirizine)
	* May increase 2-4 fold standard dose
	* Add 1st Generation H1
	* Add H2
	* Add Leukotriene receptor antagonist
	* Brief course oral steroids
	* Others: hydroxychloroquine, tacrolimus, omalizumab

## Prognosis
* Usually self-limited, responds well to therapy, and will resolve spontaneously in 2-5 years
