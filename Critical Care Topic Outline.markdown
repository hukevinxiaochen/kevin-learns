# Critical Care Topic Outline
## Sepsis and Shock
### Definition of Sepsis
The definition of sepsis was updated in 2016 in the Third International Consensus Definitions for Sepsis and Septic Shock  - [Sepsis-3](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2492881?utm_medium=referral&utm_source=r360&utm_campaign=criticalcare).

### Organ dysfunction
In the new definition, organ dysfunction can be identified as an acute change in total Sequential [Sepsis-related] Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score (range, 0–24 with higher scores indicating more severe illness) ≥2 points from baseline.

### Greater risk of death or prolonged ICU stay
The presence of two or more qSOFA criteria in the setting of suspected infection has been associated with a greater risk of death or prolonged ICU stay.

* altered mental status
* systolic blood pressure ≤ 100 mmHg
* respiratory rate ≥ 22/min

### Septic Shock
Patients with septic shock have persistent hypotension despite volume resuscitation and require vasopressors to maintain a mean arterial pressure >70 mm Hg.

### Therapy
Early Antibiotics [Kumar 2006](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/16625125/)
Volume Resuscitation
* Minimum fluid challenge of 30 cc/kg
* Norepinephrine is first-choice vasopressor

### Shock
Shock is circulatory failure that causes inadequate cellular oxygen utilization associated with the presence of the following:
	* 	systemic arterial hypotension
	* 	clinical signs of tissue hypoperfusion (cool and clammy skin, low urine output, altered mental status)
	* 	increased serum lactate level

### Vasopressors

## Respiratory Failure, ARDS, Mechanical Ventilation
Most common reasons for intubation
* Hypoxemia
* Hypercarbia

### Non Invasive
For cardiogenic pulmonary edema, continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) reduces the need for intubation and mortality

Hgh-flow nasal cannula, if available: demonstrated to decrease 90-day mortality in acute hypoxemic respiratory failures

BIPAP: indicated in hypercarbic or mixed hypercarbic/hypoxemic respiratory failure (e.g., in COPD exacerbation)

BUT CPAP and BIPAP are contraindicated in altered mental status, ARDS, aspiration risk

### Modes
Assist control sets minimum rate, patient can trigger more breaths

Vent breaths can be pressure or volume cycled

Volume cycled breaths, which deliver a set volume, are better for ARDS
