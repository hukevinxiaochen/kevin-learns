# Kick-ass Intern Survival Guide
**2017 Edition**

## Wards
### Days
		• **6:30am**: Get Signout
        ◦ Team 1 is in the Team Room (right off the elevators) and Team 2 is in the Classroom (left off the elevators) for the first two weeks, then it switches.
        ◦ Get a cover sheet from the night intern, make sure Care Team Widget is accurate for day shift.
        ◦ Take notes and make sure you know what each patient’s priorities are for the day
        ◦ Take your assigned Mobile Heartbeat phone and assign yourself to your patients
            ▪ You’ll be getting called/texted all morning, so don't forget it while rounding!
        ◦ Pro Tip: Choose 5 most-important things to be done. They may be the only ones you actually have a chance to do before noon conference
		• **7:30ish** (or whenever signout ends): See your patients
        ◦ Prioritize sickest and wards (not subspecialty) patients because you probably won’t have time to see them all
        ◦ Look through vitals, I/O’s, and labs on all wards patients so you can mention abnormals
		• **8:00am**: Morning Report. Put your phone on vibrate/mark yourself as “busy”. Nurses know you have conference, but this doesn’t always stop them from bothering you!
		• **9-10:30ish**: Rounds with your attending on all wards patients
        ◦ Bring a rolling computer (aka WOW) so you can put in orders on rounds
        ◦ If time gets short, you will table round (“sit round”)
        ◦ If you get a call while you are seeing one of your patients, hand off the phone to a fellow intern to take a message.

> Once a week Tuesday, one of the teams does Slater Rounds. The team doing Slater Rounds will skip morning report, round with the wards attending at 8:00am, and then do a child psych eval on one of your patients with Dr. Slater and his team. Prepare for this by knowing when your team is up (look in the Chiefs’ weekly email) and asking a patient the day before if they are ok with being interviewed. Explain that being in the hospital or having an illness can be challenging, and sometimes it’s nice to talk with someone about feelings… you’ll figure it out. You give a short presentation to Slater, focused on the psych aspects, and explain what you hope to get out of the interview, then the whole group goes to watch Dr. Slater interview the patient.  

		• **10:45am**: GI Rounds (Team 1) and Liver Rounds (Team 2)

        ◦ GI Rounds Tips: 
            ▪ You will be presenting to the fellow, but the attending will be there too to add his_her input.  Some attendings_fellows prefer full presentations, but others are ok with just going over to do’s/plans for each patient, especially if the patient is a frequent flyer or has been in the hospital for a long time.
            ▪ Don’t forget to ask about labs for the next morning and expected discharge date_things that need to be in place for discharge, since the specialty teams don’t always remember to let you in on the big picture planning and they may not be reachable later in the day to confirm next day_evening contingency plans.
            ▪ The GI Fellow iPhone is 646-430-3435. Text or call PRN.

        ◦ **Liver Rounds Tips:**
            ▪ These kiddos can be very complex but don't be scared: they are managed almost fully by the liver fellows, and you just put in their orders and do what they tell you. Any questions or changes you run by liver first.
            ▪ The Liver Fellow iPhone is 646-670-8063. Text or call them PRN.
            ▪ Know UOP and any other relevant calculations (like ANC if neutropenic)
            ▪ Have latest labs (especially LFTs…) and tacrolimus levels, etc.
			* The best lab indicator of liver function is… **INR**. Remember this, and have it ready for rounds.
            ▪ Dr. Lobritto and Dr. Mercedes Martinez are kinda intense and pimp. A lot. It’s OK to get it wrong, since they don't expect you to know all the answers, but just don’t let yourself get flustered; answering confidently and thoughtfully will spare you from their wrath. And beneath their scary exteriors, they actually love to teach and love questions, so ask away. 
            ▪ All liver transplant kids should be on an immunosuppressant and/or steroids. Review the orders and ask if it seems wrong. 
            ▪ End each presentation by asking what AM labs they want. In fact, double check this every time you talk to the liver fellow, because they often change their minds. Triple check your orders.
            ▪ Sometimes, it's hard to understand why the Liver Team does the things they do. It's just Liver. If pharmacy or nursing gives you problems about it, tell them or write in the order that it’s "per liver," and usually they give in.
            ▪ Hepatic dosing of Tylenol: 10mg/kg q6h, max 500mg. Sometimes they avoid ibuprofen to spare the kidneys, since at least those still work...
            ▪ Amanda, the liver NP, is an amazing resource. She will help to discharge liver kids. Always ask who might be going home because sometimes they randomly decide to discharge kids that may seem pretty sick to us. These discharges can be complicated, especially on weekends, so always try to get them lined up ahead of time.
		• Until noon: Do your Important Morning Things™
        ◦ Particularly call/page consults, put in important orders, call the heart station to confirm Echos and EKGs, and discharge any early AM discharges. 
        ◦ Get as much done as you can. Push hard. Go the distance. Make it happen.
		• **11:50ish**: Prepare for noon conference
        ◦ Briefly sign out your patients to your senior, focusing on acute to-do’s and updates, and get sign-out from the intern going to clinic on the patients you’ll be taking over
        ◦ Forward your phone to the senior… or mark yourself as busy… not sure what the protocol will be with Mobile HeartBeat. 
        ◦ If you have clinic, prepare an updated handoff for your intern that will be carrying your patient in the afternoon and sign out to the intern and senior both.
		• **12:00pm**: Noon Conference. Eat and be merry. Learn things.
		• After conference, you have the afternoon to get work done. 
        ◦ Some attendings like to table round or do radiology rounds.
        ◦ Occasionally, the teach resident does presentations at 4:00pm. These are optional if you are busy but highly encouraged.
        ◦ Discharge who you can, write your notes, make calls, re-page consults, and update the handoffs.
		• **5:00pm**: Stop. Handoff time. Stop whatever you are doing and focus on preparing for sign-out by fixing handoffs. Also update Care Team Widget with overnight intern’s info.
        ◦ Update the handoffs fully and accurately. There are lots of redundancies, so make sure they all agree with each other and with the plan.
        ◦ If you know a patient will be discharged soon, try to do as much of the discharge as possible. Your night intern will thank you for it, and your future self will, too.
		• **6:00pm**: Sign out to the night intern and finish whatever you have left from the day. 
        ◦ Put your phone back on the charger.
        ◦ You will not always get the same patients every day, so pay attention to everyone during sign out.

### Weekends
One intern carries the team list alone, with an added floater to help out this year.. Each patient requires one note between Saturday and Sunday; this includes Admission Notes and Discharge Summaries, so write progress notes only on the others. Track your progress in Column C of the Allscripts list so you don’t do extra work!. Try to save the Sunday intern from getting slammed. 

**Steps of a Discharge**
		1. Complete the Med Rec; make sure all prescriptions have been sent to the correct pharmacy!
		2. Enter a Discharge order, but change the status to HOLD. This alerts the nurse the patient will be discharged soon.
		3. Discharge Summary:
        a. Discharge diagnosis: Ideally chosen from the Problem List (use your judgment)
        b. Hospital Course: this has three sections shoved into one box.
            i. Hospital course
            ii. Discharge physical exam  (include a section for discharge day vitals)
            iii. Assessment (effectively the discharge plan)
        c. Admitting H&P (Paste HPI and PE from Admission Note)

\* Keep an accurate and up-to-date hospital course in your handoff. It will save your D-Sums from being a hellacious experience.
d.     Follow-up appointments: Must include MD name, phone number, and date. Sometimes time period to make the appointment will suffice.

###  Nights
		• Print a scut sheet for yourself. A handoff cover sheet with 10-12 rows between patients works well.
		• Receive Sign Out at 6pm weekdays.
		• Print a cover sheet for the UA of patients and your name and number 
		• Find the name for each patient’s nurse from the UA or the binders at pod desks, and write it on your scut sheet; this is more important on nights because you will be calling dozens of different nurses and it’s nice to have it on hand, in case they do not remember to assign themselves on Mobile Heartbeat.
		• See sick kids first. Try to see all kids before 10 or 11, with at least a quick check-in unless they need more. Keep track of who you see—there can be too many to easily remember.
		• Write down everything that you get called about. Everything. When you’re managing 20 patients, it’s tough to keep straight who needs what. Check things off as you do them. Organization will help you survive the night. Color coding is awesome.
		• Check in with your senior early and often, and ask for help. It’s their job to help us, especially to get acclimated. Obviously for medical things that concern you, but even for stupid order questions, like how Allscripts works, what the hell that nurse was talking about, etc.
		• Your team’s attending will call you sometime when they are still awake (usually before 11) to run the list. It really helps if you’ve seen all or most kids, but it’s not a catastrophe to say that a few are still pending.  Make sure to write down questions you have about patients during sign out so you can clarify the answers during this time.
		• Likewise, the Liver/GI fellow should call you to check on their kids around the same time. It helps to know their plans for the morning and, yes, you will get asked about their feeds.
		• The SAR will be admitting patients throughout the night, and you will be expected to help with the educational admissions.  This is new, so you’ll have to fill in details on this later!
		• The SAR may also sign out certain patients to you so that you can help lighten their task-load.  They will be the senior for you when it comes to that patient.  You are only responsible for what you’ve participated in or have been signed out. You should always tell nurses, “That patient is a SAR patient,” if they call about a kid you’ve never heard of.
		• D-Sums & discharge prep is helpful for day interns but is not your first responsibility at night.
		• Handoffs
        ◦ Be concise! Abbrevs OK.
        ◦ Record overnight events under a new heading (“Tues ON” separate from “Tues”) in the patient summary
        ◦ Update Primary To-Do to reflect consult notes since they may not have been finalized during the day
        ◦ Update days of antibiotics, POD#, etc. for the next day
        ◦ Update one-liner and active issues to reflect the patient’s current state of health
		• Morning Sign-out is 6:30am for both teams
		• **Before sign-out:**
        ◦ Start early! By 4 or 4:30, even. Don’t underestimate how long this will take, and things start to get crazy around 5 with updates from the nurses.
        ◦ Make final updates to handoffs
        ◦ Assign patients ON CARE TEAM WIDGET, including SAR patients, to interns
            ▪ Go to Amion to see who’s on (make sure to click forward to the right date!)
            ▪ Go for as much continuity as possible
            ▪ Try to distribute the acuity/busy-ness evenly
            ▪ Try to distribute Liver/GI patients evenly
            ▪ Avoid new or super complex patients for interns with clinic
            ▪ Assign clinic intern’s patients to afternoon coverage by another intern
            ▪ Assign sub-interns, too. Ask the Sr for guidance if unsure how many. 
								• Be mindful that 3rd-year medical students cannot follow a sub-i’s patient. It can be tough to remember, but try to avoid this because it nullifies their ability to follow, write notes, and present. Remember being a student yourself, and how much that would suck.)
            ▪ Double click the name in Column B of the Allscripts patient list to edit it
        ◦ Print out a BOTH a roster from the Care Team Widget AND a cover sheet (first page from the Handoff)
        ◦ Write interns’ names next to their patients
            ▪ For clinic assignments, use an arrow (e.g. “Hector → Josh”)
        ◦ Write the names, phone numbers, and pager numbers below the roster
        ◦ Make copies (copier code: 44100)
            ▪ Give one copy of both the Care Team Widget roster and the cover sheet roster to the UA in front
            ▪ Give one copy to each team member at sign-out
        ◦ Print 2 copies of the handoffs for the whole list
            ▪ One stack for you to read while signing out 
            ▪ The other, divided into appropriate piles, for the incoming interns
            ▪ you may only need one copy later in the year as sign out becomes more second-nature.  By the end of our intern year, we shared off of one copy.
		• At sign-out, balance conciseness with completeness: a good starting place is to do a brief one-liner, mention important Active Issues, then go into the overnight events; finish up with to-do’s. Obviously, modify this as your seniors instruct and the situation demands.
		• When the SAR arrives to sign out their kids, it’s good manners to let them cut in after you finish the current patient.
