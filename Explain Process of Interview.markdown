# Explain Process of Interview
[[Routine]] > [[Clinical Interview]] > Explain Process of Interview
My name is Dr. Hu. You can call me Kevin.
I apologize in advance for the mere 7 minutes I can afford for our interview today.
In this short time, my goal is to identify if there exists any medical emergency, formulate an initial plan, and determine when you should see a doctor next.
In order to do so, it is part of my routine to ask personal questions that cover a wide range of topics from your health, smoking, drinking, working, to schooling, and private sexual life.
When we are done, I’ll summarize, you’ll have a chance to ask questions, I’ll discuss with my supervisors, and come back to discuss and explain the final plan.
Any questions before we begin?
