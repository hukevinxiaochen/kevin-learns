# Residency Swap
#temporary

Obtain your supporting documents. You should be 100% ready to start residency when you send your emails. Documents should include:
At least 3 letters of recommendation. If you are in residency, one letter should be from your program director.
Official USMLE transcripts.
Medical school transcript.
Dean's Letter/MSPE
For Foreign Medical Graduates: ECFMG certificate and visa status.
Scan these documents. Purchase a USB flash drive to store the scanned files and carry them with you or, alternatively, use your ResidentSwap Online Folder.
When you receive an alert of a new opening, be ready to quickly send your supporting documents. Some spots are taken in as little as a few hours.
Avoid sending your supporting documents as email attachments; these files are too large and may result in your emails not getting through.
Instead, you can upload them onto your ResidentSwap account and include the link to your online folder in your emails to the residency programs. This method allows the programs to easily view your complete application. You can also fax or mail copies of your documents.
Prepare a brief cover letter that explains why you are interested in the specialty / location.
TIP: Also ask about positions starting next July.
TIP: If you currently do not have a spot, consider also inquiring about research/volunteer opportunities that may be available at the institution.
Write or update your CV in a word processor of your choice. Make sure to proof read it.
I recommend that you then prepare two versions of your CV: one in a printable Adobe Acrobat PDF format, the other in a text-only format that is easily read in the text body of an email without having to open attachments.
TIP: to convert your CV to Adobe Acrobat PDF format, download and install the free Primo-PDF utility. It's generally better to send PDF files than e.g. Microsoft Word attachments because PDF files tend to be better at preserving formatting, and ensure the same font will be used. Some receipients may also not be able to open MS Word attachments easily.
To make a text-only, formatting-free version of your CV, copy and paste it into e.g. Microsoft Notepad. This will remove all formatting (e.g. underlines, bold, italic text). This is neccesserry as many email programs will not correctly display formatted text. Turn off any "word-wrap" features in notepad and make the CV look nice by inserting spaces to make indentations. Each line should contain no more than 60 spaces and letters. Press Enter at the end of each line and wrap text by hand.
Make a list of programs to which you want to send your CV. Keep in mind that vast majority of the programs will be filled and so you should send your CV to at least 50-100 programs. Ideally, each of your cover letters should be individually addressed to the program director.
The ResidentSwap Email Tool can automatically personalize each copy of your emails by addressing them to the program director & coordinator. It can also help you select programs based on the geographical region.
Finally, copy & paste your cover letter and the text-only version of yor CV into an email and attach the Adobe Acrobat PDF version of your CV in case the program coordinator wants to print it.

Dear {greeting},

I am currently finishing PGY-1 in Surgery and I would like to switch to Nuclear Medicine.

I have been fascinated with applications of radiation in medicine since college, where I had the opportunity to take a graduate course, "Radiation in Medicine."  This interest grew stronger in medical school where I learned how radioactive compounds can be used to study physiology and diagnose multitude of medical conditions.

Please consider me should you have any unexpected openings.  I would also appreciate any information about research opportunities at your program.  I am including my CV in a text-only version below and also as a printable Adobe Acrobat file attached to this email.  I look forward to hearing from you.

Best Regards,
John Smith, MD
