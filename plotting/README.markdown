These notebooks discuss how to visualize data using different programming languages and approaches: namely matplotlib, lattice, and ggplot2. By learning how to do basic things using all three, a deeper understanding of API design as well as software architecture might be obtained.

To run these notebooks, and to continue to add on - just run `jupyter notebook` at the command line.

Some system parameters:


* Python 3.5.2 installed by pyenv using framework flag
* `env PYTHON_CONFIGURE_OPTS="--enable-framework" pyenv install 3.5.2`
* R 3.3.2 installed by a package downloaded from <http://cran.case.edu/>
