Your main priority is being on top of L&D and OB Triage. This is great learning and things can change a lot in a short amount of time so try to be there when you can. 
You should write notes every 2h on all actively laboring patients and every 4h on latent labor patients. Cervical ripening for inductions can be every 8h. 
You also need to write a note any time there is an event or intervention, eg RN calls you for abnormal strip, you see the pt, check cervix, reposition, bolus. 
Try to get in the habit of writing a note IMMEDIATELY after you see the patient--this will help you a lot in your future.  Notes can (and usually should) be quite brief.  
Night resident should round on mother-baby pairs as time permits before signout to help out the day team.  However, RN's have asked that we do not round there earlier than 5:30am.  Try not to wake anyone up if you can avoid it.
NF can also prep for discharges by filling out discharge workflow, printing rx's, etc.
Do procedures!!  There is a "Skills Competency Checklist" form in the MCH binder that interns should use.  Once you feel competent in a procedure ask attendings to "sign off" that you are ready to do that procedure independently. Please hold onto that form and turn into me when completed.
Our residents mostly see "Tier 1" moms, the same ones that the family doc's and CNM's manage, but see babies of both T1 and T2 moms.  Rounding on T2 mom's you know can be discussed with the on-call OB.

Working with other residents

SCH Family Medicine: they work with all delivering providers except the SCH CNM group, including Erie.  They have their continuity clinic at Erie Foster.  They need to get 40 deliveries in their 2 months on the rotation.

SCH Emergency Medicine: also work with all providers except CNM.  They need 10 deliveries on their 1 month rotation

Rush OB/GYN: they have multiple residents that rotate at SCH.  Interns and 2nd years work mainly on L&D, while 3rd/4th years mostly do Gyn surgeries.  They work with all of the provider groups.  

Since Erie is one of the busiest groups at SCH we divide up patients among the various learners.  Northwestern residents prioritize Erie HP and Division St patients, while SCH residents prioritize Foster.  However, residents should work with each other to ensure a fairly equal workload and take turns assuming care of new triages/laboring patients.  Rush residents share in this workload and also act as consultants for higher-risk patients.

A few more notes

PLEASE be sure to come to the nursing "board rounds" at 7am/7pm.  It is very important to the RN's that you are there.  It can be a bit tedious since at least 1/2 is nursing business, but you should also be prepared to present a brief 1-liner about any Erie patients on the board (eg, name, G'sP's, ega, why admitted, last exam, complications).  Usually lasts about 15 min.

Make sure to communicate regularly with the RN's!  Try to let them know before you examine a patient, and be sure to update them regularly regarding the plan of care.

Callrooms
 
Unfortunately SCH is not well-supplied with call rooms for the OB floor.  There are 3 (including the one our residents typically use which is by the vending machines).  However, these are shared with residents and attending from various groups including Erie. Despite that, on most nights it has been fine for the resident to use the one by the vending machines.  However, if it is in use it you will need to use one of the many resident callrooms in the Andersen Pavillion.

If you need a quiet place to work there is a conference room across the waiting room from the L&D entrance, entrance code is 350, you are welcome to use it when not occupied for meetings.
