**Source** UpToDate. Approach to the evaluation of dysphagia in adults.

**Dysphagia** is a subjective sensation of difficulty or abnormality of swallowing.
**Odynophagia** is pain with swallowing.
**Globus sensation** is a functional esophageal disorder characterized by a sensation of a lump, tightness or retained food bolus in the pharyngeal or cervical area that is not due to an underlying structural abnormality, gastroesophageal reflux disease, or an esophageal motility disorder.
