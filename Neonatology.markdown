## Core Topics
- [x] [[Growth]]
- [ ] Infants < 35 w gestation
- [x] Apgar score assignment

* 5 and 10 min Apgar less than 5 confer increased relative risk of cerebral palsy.
* Change in Apgar between 1 and 5 min indicate response to resuscitation
[The Apgar Score | From the American Academy of Pediatrics | Pediatrics](http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/136/4/819)
* Per the Philadelphia Guide, a 5 min score less than 3 is associated with increased mortality.

### Heart Rate
* Absent
* Slow (< 100 bpm)
* > 100 bpm

### Color
* Blue
* Acrocyanosis
* Totally pink

### Reflex Irritability
* No response
* Grimace
* Cough, sneeze, cry

### Respiration

* Active Motion

- [ ] Hyperbilirubinemia
* [[Neonatal Hyperbilirubinemia]]
* Phototherapy

- [ ] Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome
* Eat Sleep Console

- [x] Possible sepsis

Early-onset sepsis - deﬁned by the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development and Vermont Oxford Networks as sepsis with onset at ≤3 days of age.
[Management of Neonates With Suspected or Proven Early-Onset Bacterial Sepsis | From the American Academy of Pediatrics | Pediatrics](http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/129/5/1006)

* Infant birth weight is inversely related to risk of early-onset sepsis related to immaturity of innate and adaptive immunity.
* Maternal GBS - adequate treatment is 1 dose at 4 or more hours before delivery (per **NMH NICU Resident Survival Guide**)
* Intramniotic infection or inflammation - Maternal fever intrapartum or postpartum
* Prolonged rupture of membranes - greater than 18 hours
* Previous infant with invasive GBS
* GBS bacteriuria

- [ ] Respiratory Distress
* Etiologies:
	* Surfactant deficiency causes Respiratory Distress Syndrome (RDS)
	* Infection produces Pneumonia
	* Meconium aspiration gives a chemical pneumonitis
	* Hydrops fetalis yields anemia and hypoalbuminemia with heart failure and pulmonary edema
	* Congenital or acquired pulmonary hypoplasia causes pulmonary hypertension
	* Slower than normal clearing of fluid from lungs can lead to Transient Tachypnea of Newborn (TTN) **Source** Nelson’s Essentials
	* By Gestational Age:
		* Preterm: RDS, Erythroblastosis fettles, Nonimmune hydrous, Pulmonary hemorrhage
		* Term: Persistent Pulmonary Hypertension of the Neonate (PPHN), Meconium Aspiration Syndrome (MAS), Polycythemia, Amniotic Fluid Aspiration
		* Everyone: Bacterial sepsis, transient tachypnea, spontaneous pneumothorax, congenital anomalies, congenital heart disease, pulmonary hypoplasia

- [ ] [[Meconium-stained amniotic fluid]]
- [x] Seizures

* In contrast to seizures, jitteriness and tremors are sensory dependent, elicited by stimuli, and interrupted by holding the extremity. Seizures may be associated with abnormal eye movements, such as tonic deviation to one side. Subtle signs of seizure activity include apnea, eye deviation, tongue thrusting, eye blinking, fluctuation of vital signs, and staring. Continuous EEG can help clarify the diagnosis (Per **Nelson’s Pediatrics**).
* Diagnose with capillary blood glucose, metabolic panel, bilirubin panel, and CSF / Blood cultures as needed.
* Look for signs of increased ICP (bulging fontanelle)
	* LP, Cerebral US, MRI, workup IEM if needed

- [ ] Hypoglycemia
- [x] Apnea of Prematurity
* Apnea is the cessation of respiration for >20 seconds or for a shorter duration if it is associated with cyanosis and/or bradycardia. (Per **NMH NICU Resident Survival Guide**)
* Periodic breathing is normal & common in term infants, and is defined as a pattern of three or more respiratory pauses of >3 seconds’ duration (each) with <20 seconds of respirations between pauses. It is not associated with bradycardia. (Per **NMH NICU Resident Survival Guide**)
* Etiology may be immaturity of respiratory control system, but it may be a presenting sign of other diseases:
	* CNS: IVH, drugs, seizures, hypoxic injury
	* Respiratory: pneumonia, obstructive airway lesions, atelectasis, laryngeal reflex, phrenic nerve paralysis, severe RDS, pneumothorax
	* Infectious: Sepsis, NEC, meningitis
	* Gastrointestinal: Oral feeding, bowel movements, GERD, esophagitis, intestinal perforation
	* Metabolic: Low glucose, hypocalcemia, hypoxemia, hypo or hypernatremia, hyperammonemia, organic acid accumulation, increased ambient temperature, hypothermia
	* Cardiovascular: Hypo or hypertension, heart failure, anemia, hypovolemia, change in vagal tone
	* Other: sleep state, upper airway collapse
* Treat with methylxanthines (theophylline, caffeine), CPAP, and patience.
	* Side Effects: Tachycardia, Reflux, Increased metabolic rate

- [ ] Circumcision

- [ ] Fluids and Nutrition
* Physiology
	* TBW varies with age
	* High in fetus
	* 75% wt in term newborn
	* 60% wt in year-old infant
	* Males with muscles have 60% TBW wt
	* Females with fat have 50% TBW wt
	* TBW composed of ICF and ECF
		* ECF > ICF in fetus and newborn
		* Postnatal diuresis causes immediate decrease in ECF volume
		* ICF expands due to cell growth
		* By 1 year of age ICF to ECF similar to adults
			* 20 to 25% by wt ECF
			* 30 to 40% by wt ICF
	* ECF can be divided into Plasma water and Interstitial
		* Plasma is 5% wt
		* Interstitial 15% wt
			* Increases dramatically in heart failure, protein-losing enteropathy, liver failure, nephrotic syndrome
		* Blood when 40% hematocrit is 8% wt
			* Higher in newborns and infants
	* Normal osmolality depends on water balance
		* Normal is 285 to 295 mOsm / kg
		* Water intake
			* Thirst when osmolality increases
		* Urinary losses
			* ADH when osmolality increases
		* Volume status wins over osmolality
			* When volume-depleted, ADH and thirst are stimulated no matter the plasma osmolality
	* Volume status depends on sodium balance
		* Sodium content depends on kidneys
		* RAAS is the regulator of sodium reabsorption in kidneys
		* Renin is produced in response to decreased effective intravascular volume
		* Atrial Natriuretic Peptide stimulates urinary sodium excretion when intravascular volume is expanded
* Maintenance Fluids
	* Glucose is meant to prevent starvation ketoacidosis and diminishes protein degradation that would occur if patient received no calories
	* Replaces measurable and not measurable losses
	* Measurable
			* Urine
			* Stool
			* Blood
			* Emesis
			* Drains
			* Suction
	* Not measurable (Insensible)
			* Skin
				* Evaporative
				* Sweat
			* Lungs
				* Respiratory Rate
				* Mechanical Vent
				* Tracheostomy
	* Sometimes includes additional replacement for other types of ongoing losses
		* e.g. NG tube drainage
	* Body weight method for 24-hr maintenance water needs
		* 0-10 kg   4 mL / kg / h
		* 11-20 kg 2 mL / kg / h
		* > 20 kg   1 mL / kg / h
	* 1/4 NaCl for younger kids who are more water
	* 1/2 NaCl for older kids who are less water
* Deficit Replacement for dehydration in kids
	* Mild 3%, Moderate 6%, Severe 9%
		* Mild: Urine output, decreased
		* Moderate: Urine output, decreased; some tachycardia; decreased tear production
		* Severe: Anuric, Heart rate, Dry Mucous Membrane, Fontanelles, Tenting, BP
	* Normal water loss
		* Urine 60%
		* Skin and Lungs 35%
		* Stool 5%
	* Exacerbate normal water loss
		* Radiant warmers
		* Phototherapy
		* Fever
		* Tachypnea
	* First replace isotonic volume at 20 mL/kg
		* After volume depletion signs resolve, give another bolus
		* Get labs
* Hypernatremia
	* Correct slower than 12 mEq/L every 24 hours
* Hyponatremia
	* Correct slower than 10 mEq/L every 24 hours
* Oral Rehydration
	* 50 mL / kg within 4 hours for mild dehydration
	* 100 mL / kg within 4 hours for moderate
	* Maintain at 100 mL / kg in 24 hours
	* 10 mL / kg for every stool
* 120 kcal / kg / day
* Dextrose 1 gram has 3.4 kcal / gm
* Normal BP
	* 70 + (Age in years x 2)
