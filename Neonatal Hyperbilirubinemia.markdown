## Motivation
* Common
* Neurological consequences can be devastating
* ABE and CBE suck

## History
* Prior to the introduction of exchange transfusion, severe neonatal hyperbilirubinemia was generally due to Rh hemolytic disease and perinatal sepsis, and often complicated with birth asphyxia.
* Kernicterus was one of the major pediatric problems in the early 20th century (prior to the 1950s).
* Then, thanks to: prenatal diagnosis of Rh isoimmunization, use of exchange transfusions refined —> evidence-based management of Rh disease was delineated.
* Availability of anti-D immune globulin (Rhogam) reduced the incidence of Rh isoimmunization and hemolysis.
* Advent of phototherapy and its liberal use in the United States in the late 1960s and early 1970s led to the effective management of severe neonatal hyperbilirubinemia.

## Epidemiology
* The data came from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project family of databases. The Nationwide Inpatient Sample and the Kids’ Inpatient Database were combined to generate trend data for the years 1988–2005. All neonatal discharges with primary or secondary International Classiﬁcation of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modiﬁcation diagnoses codes for jaundice or kernicterus occurring within the ﬁrst 30 days of life were selected with population incidence rates calculated from estimates of term and preterm newborn hospitalizations derived from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project data. To increase the reliability of identiﬁed kernicterus hospitalizations, newborns with a diagnosis of kernicterus and a procedure code for phototherapy or exchange transfusion were included as cases.
* Total Serum Bili exceeding 1 mg/dL occurs in almost all term and near-term newborn infants
* Severe hyperbilirubinemia is a risk factor for:
	* Acute bilirubin encephalopathy (ABE)
	* Chronic bilirubin encephalopathy (CBE)  i.e. Kernicterus
		* Dystonia
		* Choreoathetosis
		* Hearing Loss
		* Ocular pareses
* Babies who develop severe hyperbilirubinemia tend to have multiple risk factors:
	* Indeed, in infants with peak TSB levels greater than or equal to 25 mg_dL (428 µmol_L), 88% had a least two and 43% had three or more identified risk factors in one report (Newman et al., 2000), and 58% with peak TSB greater than or equal to 20 mg_dL (342 µmol_L) had at least two risk factors in another (Huang et al., 2004).

## Pathogenesis
Neonatal physiology and pathophysiology : Causes of Indirect Hyperbilirubinemia in Neonates
	* Increased Bilirubin Load
		* Hemolytic disease
			* Immune-mediated: ABORh Incompatibility
				* Suspect in mother-infant pair in which infant expresses a red cell antigen foreign to mother, presence of maternal antibody directed against infant RBC antigen (find on an antibody screen), positive direct antiglobulin (Coombs) test indicating maternal antibody bound to the infant RBC.
				* Mothers with known alloimmunization are not candidates for anti-D immune globulin (Rhogam) as it is ineffective at reducing severity of disease. Monitoring with maternal anti-D titers, fetal MCA PSV measurements, Fetal treatment with IUFT are mainstays (experimental: Maternal plasmapheresis and IVIG)
				* Regarding ABO, ABO incompatibility occurs in O group mothers. Also occasionally in A and B group mothers but does not seem to be clinically significant (**Source** Ozolek, Watchko, and Mimouni, “Prevalence and Lack of Clinical Significance of Blood Group Incompatibility in Mothers with Blood Type A or B.”). Even in O group mothers, severe disease is rare in a system implementing a universal bilirubin screening program. (**Source** Christensen et al., “ABO Hemolytic Disease of the Fetus and Newborn.”)
			* Enzyme Deficiencies: G6PD, Pyruvate Kinase
				* Of the 5 cases of kernicterus in the Intermountain Health System dataset 2 had G6PD (**Source** Christensen et al., “ABO Hemolytic Disease of the Fetus and Newborn.”)
				* Classically Africa, the Middle East, East Asia, and the Mediterranean ethnicity. In the US at-risk populations are 12.2% for African-American males and 4.1% for African-American females (Chinevere et al., 2006). Other subgroups at risk for G6PD deficiency include newborns of East Asian, Greek, Italian (especially Sardinia and Sicily), and Middle Eastern descent (Kaplan et al., 2004).
				* Accounts for 20% of neonates with kernicterus in the United States Pilot Kernicterus registry (20.8% of all reported cases) (Bhutani et al., 2004; Johnson et al., 2009) via Avery 84.
				* Common drugs that can trigger hemolysis:
					* TMP/SMX
					* Nitrofurantoin
					* Acetaminophen
					* Vitamin C
					* Fava Beans
					* Tolbutamide in Vitamin K
					* Sepsis and other acute illnesses (NEC, etc.)
			* Membrane Defects: Hereditary Spherocytosis
			* Hemoglobinopathies: Alpha-thalassemia
			* Sepsis
		* Extravascular and Sequestration of Blood (Cephalohematoma)
		* Polycythemia (Infants of Diabetic Mothers)
	* Increased Enterohepatic Circulation
		* Intestinal obstruction, pyloric stenosis
		* Ileus, meconium plugging, cystic fibrosis
		* Breast-milk feeding
	* Decreased Bilirubin Clearance
		* Inherited UGT1A1 defects: Criggler Najjar
			* Type 1 - more severe, autosomal recessive, lifelong phototherapy
			* Type 2 - phenobarbital treatment
			* Gilbert Syndrome - 9% US population is homozygous for this, 42% heterozygous
		* Congenital hypothyroidism 
		* Galactosemia
		* Diabetes
## Major Hyperbilirubinemia Risk Factors
* Exclusive breast feeding (particularly with poor feeding and excessive weight loss)
	* No increased production of bilirubin here
	* 1 report associates breast milk with severe hyperbilirubinemia in babies with certain UGT1A1 and SLCO1B1 variants.
	* Increased enterohepatic circulation associated with dehydration	
* East Asian race
	* No increased production
	* UGT1A1 variants far more prevalent - each associated with a Gilbert syndrome phenotype
	* No relevant enterohepatic circulation effects
* Jaundice within first 24 hours of life
	* Have higher suspicion for hemolytic disease
* Cephalohematoma or significant bruising
	* Extravascular blood manifests 48-72 hours later
* Previous sibling treated with phototherapy
	* Genetic effects likely play a role here is a higher concordance level in TSB between monozygotic (identical) than dizygotic (fraternal) twins when controlled for confounders that modulate neonatal bilirubinemia (Ebbesen and Mortensen, 2003).
* Late preterm (especially 35-36 weeks)
* Blood group incompatibility with DAT positive
* Predischarge TSB or TcB level in the high-risk zone

### History and Physical
#### Jaundice
Adults get jaundiced at 2.0 mg per dL
Neonates do not appear jaundiced until 5-7 mg per dL
Progresses cephalocaudal
_Visual estimation of jaundice can lead to errors._ (cautions the AAP)
In theory:
* Absence of jaundice has excellent negative predictive value for developing TSB that merits phototherapy.
* Face and upper chest predicts TSB < 12 mg per dL
* Conjunctival icterus with TSB > 14.9 mg per dL
### Labs
* A TSB or TcB measured 18–36 hours after birth interpreted according to the infant’s age in hours using the Bhutani hour-specific nomogram (see Fig. 84.4) significantly improves the prediction of subsequent severe hyperbilirubinemia (Newman et al., 2005;Keren et al., 2008; (Maisels et al., 2009a). As outlined in Fig. 84.9 (Maisels et al., 2009b)

	* Breastfeeding Support (www.aap.org/bookstore)
* Maternal blood type
* Maternal type and screen
* Newborn blood type
* Direct antiglobulin test a.k.a. Direct Coombs Test washes RBCs and treats with anti-IgG and or anti-C3b mAbs or antisera and detects agglutination or some other endpoint (**Source** Pathogenesis of autoimmune hemolytic anemia: Warm agglutinins and drugs via UpToDate)
	* Physiologic false positive may occur in women who received anti-D immune globulin earlier in pregnancy. (**Source**: Bowman et al., 1978; Judd, 2001; Maayan-Metzger et al., 2001 via Avery 84 10th Edition)

* Albumin

### Definition of Pathologic Jaundice
* Present in first 24 hours of life
* TSB level > age-specific 95%
* TSB rising > 0.2 mg per dL
* Conjugated bili (BC) > 1.5 mg/dL or > 20% TSB

Prevent kernicterus
* Optimize oral intake
	* Encourage breastfeeding
	* Troubleshoot breastfeeding
	* Lactation consultant
	* Do not routinely supplement with water or dextrose water because it will not prevent hyperbilirubinemia or decrease TSB levels
* N.B. There are no guidelines for infants born earlier than 35 weeks’ gestation.
* Perform regular risk assessments for severe hyperbilirubinemia.
	* Get maternal ABO and Rh(D)
	* If none, get direct antibody test (Coomb’s)
	* If O+, either get DAT or have appropriate surveillance, risk assessment, and follow-up (For definition of appropriate surveillance, risk assessment, and follow-up see Lazar L, Litwin A, Merlob P. Phototherapy for neonatal nonhemolytic hyperbilirubinemia. Analysis of rebound and indications for discontinuing therapy. Clin Pediatr (Phila). 1993;32:264–267)
	* One might calculate a phototherapy threshold for preterm infants less than 35 weeks using a rule of thumb: BW (kg) x 10 / 2

### Phototherapy
* We are talking about high-intensity phototherapy: at least 30 microW per cm2 per nm (measured at infant skin directly below center of phototherapy unit). Use a manufacturer-specified spectroradiometer.
	* Plateau or increase of TSB under lights suggestive of hemolysis
* If considering phototherapy, one must consider risk factors for neurotoxicity.
	* Isoimmune hemolytic disease
	* G6PD
	* Asphyxia
	* Lethargy
	* Temperature instability
	* Sepsis
	* Acidosis
	* Albumin < 3.0 g per dL
* `F20 T12/BB` or `PL52/20W` provide greater irradiance than regular `F20T12/B`
* Avoid sun therapy because it is difficult to determine a safe timeframe from sunburn (Pediatrics. 2004;114: 297–316)
* Cover the baby’s eyes
* Potential Adverse effects of Phototherapy (**Source**: UpToDate)
	* Bronze baby syndrome - when babies with direct hyperbilirubinemia are exposed to lights
	* Seizure
	* Childhood cancer
	* Melanocytic nevi
	* Unknown retinal effect
	* No effect on childhood asthma

### IVIG
* In immune-mediated disease with rising TSB despite phototherapy and within 2-3 mg per dL of exchange transfusion threshold

### Exchange Transfusion
Removes antibody-coated RBCs
Corrects anemia
Removes maternal antibody
“Double volume” is an exchange of twice the neonatal blood volume
25% of total body bili and 110% of circulating bili
Post-exchange rebound bill should be 70-80% of pre-exchange levels
UVC
Irradiated blood
40% hematocrit with pRBCs
FFP
Less than 72 hours old
Warmed

Fun fact:
Finally, although the risk is now very low, the risks per tested unit for known transfusiontransmitted viruses in the United States are as follows: for the human immunodeficiency virus, 1 : 1,467,000; for the hepatitis C virus, 1 : 1,149,000; and for the hepatitis B virus, 1 : 282,000 (Carson et al., 2012).
