* Ceftriaxone IgG (Warm) Positive Drug-induced hemolysis (most common cause is cephalosporins) Haptin related
* ![](Hematology%20Board%20Review/Photo%20Oct%2023,%202018%20at%20120721.jpg)
* Above photo shows inclusion in RBC related to a transfusion-transmitted infection Babesiosis
* CMV is a mono-like syndrome
* Not all blood is screened for Babesiosis
* Hilar small cell lung cancer without metastasis should be treated with chemo and radiation (25% cure rate)
* < 3 cm tumor is resectable
* Gleason 8 Prostate Cancer extending beyond capsule is high risk with GnRH agonist and radiation
* Stage IA Cervical Cancer is amenable to fertility-preserving conization
* In a premenopausal woman, Stage IIA invasive ductal carcinoma of breast ER and PR positive HER2 negative s/p 5 years of tamoxifen should be managed with tamoxifen of total of 10 years (continue for 5 more years)
* 22 year-old man with Hodgkin lymphoma gets chemo regardless of bone marrow biopsy
* Stage 2A invasive ductal carcinoma of breast HER2 positive and hormone receptor negative can be treated with chemo but it can be delayed for her to see a fertility specialist.
* A woman with suppressed CA125 s-p TAHBSO and chemo for stage IIIA high grade serous ovarian cancer does not need imaging unless symptomatic or CA125 rises again.
* All women with ovarian cancer should receive BRCA testing.
* Exemestane can prevent invasive breast cancer for postmenopausal women with LCIS and atypical lobular hyperplasia with history of VTE
	* Raloxifene and Tamoxifen raise VTE risk
	* Exemestane does not raise VTE risk
* Testing for EGFR mutation is necessary to treat lung adenocarcinoma with liver metastases (erlotinib)
* Active surveillance is appropriate for Gleason 6 and PSA < 10
	* Check PSAs, do DREs, and biopsy at intervals
* Surgical lymph node biopsy is necessary when nodes are easily accessible.
* Core lymph node biopsy is better when nodes are difficult to access.
* Investigate if lymphadenopathy continues for 6-8 weeks
* Lung squamous cell carcinoma with bone metastasis May be helped with palliative care and platinum-based chemo.
	* Palliative care improves quality and duration of life
* In CLL, patients are prone to infections due to low immunoglobulins. 
	* IVIG can help.
* Vocal fold nodule in smoker is assumed to be early stage squamous cell carcinoma and treated with radiation (early stage squamous cell cancer).
* G-CSF is better for preventing than treating neutropenia.
* 103 : B : GIST with KIT (tyrosine receptor) gene responsive to imatinib (Gleevac) - a tyrosine kinase inhibitor
* 104 : B : Mediastinoscopy is indicated for SVC syndrome. There is usually time to make a tissue diagnosis.
* 107 : D : Extensive hypodense lesions replacing more than 50% of the liver > supportive management and hospice care
