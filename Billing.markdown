Level IV requires attending exam

“Hi, Kevin - just FYI, this is a pretty complicated pt and you covered a lot of ground here, so this could easily be a Level 4 visit. We can leave it as is for now, but if you ever have a pt w/3 or more chronic issues and use a lot of thinking power, consider a higher level visit (attending would have to see pt in order to bill accordingly.)”

## Background
Medicare’s Documentation Guidelines for Evaluation and Management Services, which most private payers also rely on to a great degree, divides documentation into three key components:

* History
* Exam
* Medical decision making
