### Class
* Never use a LABA by itself () - increased mortality

### Pumps
* Budesonide has the most data for safety in pregnancy
* Albuterol is safe in pregnancy as well
* LABA not very much data in pregnancy

### Exacerbations
* Use PEF as measure of response to treatment
* Imminent respiratory failure from altered mental status, bradycardia, pCO2 > 42
* Initial treatment of asthma exacerbation at home can be up to 2 treatments 20 minute apart with albuterol with PF measurement
* Good response to initial treatment in an exacerbation with PF > 80% of personal best and can continue SABA q3-4 h for next 24-48 hours

### Triggers
* Sulfites in food can worsen asthma symptoms - processed potatoes, wine, beer, dried fruit, shrimp
* Adenosine and Dypyridamole worsen bronchospasm for stress test
