Fluid responsiveness was defined as an increase in cardiac output following intravenous fluid administration.

Augmentation of cardiac output or related parameters following passive leg raising predicted fluid responsiveness (positive LR, 11 [95% CI, 7.6-17]; pooled specificity, 92%). Conversely, the lack of an increase in cardiac output with passive leg raising identified patients unlikely to be fluid responsive (negative LR, 0.13 [95% CI, 0.07-0.22]; pooled sensitivity, 88%).

An increase in pulse pressure of at least 10% increased the likelihood of fluid responsiveness (summary specificity, 83%; positive LR, 3.6 [95% CI, 2.5-5.4]) and patients with a smaller increase had a lower likelihood of fluid responsiveness (summary sensitivity, 62%; negative LR, 0.45 [95% CI, 0.36-0.57]). At a pretest probability of 50%, these results confer a positive predictive value of 78% and a negative predictive value of 31%.
