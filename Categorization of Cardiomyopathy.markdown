## AHA 2007
"Cardiomyopathies are a heterogeneous group of diseases of the myocardium associated with mechanical and/or electrical dysfunction that usually (but not invariably) exhibit inappropriate ventricular hypertrophy or dilation and are due to a variety of causes that frequently are genetic. Cardiomyopathies either are confined to the heart or are a part of generalized systemic disorders, often leading to cardiovascular death or progressive heart failure-related disability." 

The AHA definition and classification are not intended to provide methodologies for clinical diagnosis, but are rather a scientific scheme that aims to aid in the understanding of this complex group of disorders.

## ESC 2008
"A myocardial disorder in which the heart muscle is structurally and functionally abnormal in the absence of coronary artery disease, hypertension, valvular disease and congenital heart disease sufficient to explain the observed myocardial abnormality"

## Use of the term Ischemic Cardiomyopathy
The use of the term "cardiomyopathy" to describe valvular, ischemic, or hypertensive heart disease unnecessarily broadens a term best suited to predominantly reflect genetically determined diseases with recognizable phenotypes. However, the term "ischemic cardiomyopathy" continues to be used by some, including the 2013 American College of Cardiology Foundation/American Heart Association heart failure guidelines, the 2010 Heart Failure Society of America guidelines, and the 2008 Canadian Cardiovascular Society guidelines.
