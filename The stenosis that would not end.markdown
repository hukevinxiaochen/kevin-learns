Last night, I took care of a patient who died in the operating room. She was there to receive a tracheostomy from the ear, nose, and throat doctors. This was all part of a way to establish an airway in someone who was altered from hypercarbic respiratory acidosis.

This patient was young, 47, but suffered from COPD presumably due to an extensive 35 pack-year smoking history and significant WTC 9/11 exposures in the days immediately following the event. She’d also had a thyroidectomy for goiter. Prior to that, she’d already had Hashimoto’s thyroiditis (autoimmune hypothyroidism). She had been admitted to the ICU just 4 to 6 weeks prior for an RSV-triggered COPD exacerbation requiring intubation. For some reason, she needed to be re-intubated twice. This meant 3 total intubations in that 1 month, with the last one occurring just 2 to 4 weeks prior to her current presentation to me in the ICU.

Anesthesiology was unable to intubate. ENT saw subglottic stenosis on their fiberoptic. The next step was to get past the stenosis in the OR with a tracheostomy.

The stenosis kept going though. They were able to enter the trachea and establish a tracheostomy tube without much issue. However, they found that the patient was not oxygenating. Despite multiple attempts to pass a tube past the distal stenosis, the patient eventually coded in the OR. Her life ended.

Flashback to the preoperative period:

While we waited for ENT to arrive, anesthesiology was able to establish a laryngeal mask airway. When ENT did arrive, they passed their fiberoptic camera through the LMA to diagnose subglottic stenosis, an indication for tracheostomy.

While ENT coordinated an OR, the respiratory therapist and I noted that the patient could not tolerate volume control ventilation with peak pressures in the high 40s. So we kept her on pressure control.

On pressure control at a peak pressure of 30 and inspiratory time setting of 1 second - this patient was set at 18 breaths and breathing tidal volumes in the low 200s. This was a minute ventilation in the 3000s. This was not adequate. I did not realize this at the time.

This moment makes me recall another young patient, 32 years of age, asthmatic, influenza A, intubated but with high peak pressures and insufficient ventilation on pressure control for whom we consulted ECMO for cannulation.
