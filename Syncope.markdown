# Syncope
[[FMS 2nd Month Must-Know Topics v0.2]] > 

**Source** Louisville Lectures
## Definition
Transient loss of consciousness, loss of postural tone with spontaneous recovery resulting from decreased global cerebral perfusion (~1 min).

TIAs/Strokes do not cause syncope by definition. Seizures also do not. Narcoleptic attack are not syncope. Vertigo is not syncope.
## Etiologic Classes
### Neurocardiogenic
Vasovagal
Carotid sinus sensitivity
Orthostatic hypotension
### Cardiac
Arrhythmia (HOCM, ARVD, WPW/PES, Long QT, Brugada)
Structural heart problems
Acute coronary syndrome
## Pathophysiology
### Vasovagal
Reflex withdrawal of sympathetic tone
Increase in vagal tone
### Carotid Sinus
Mechanical manipulation of carotid bodies alters sympathetic and parasympathetic tone
### Arrhythmia
Brady and Tachycardias leading to suboptimal cardiac output
### Structural disease
Valvular pathology, tumors, tamponade all leading to suboptimal cardiac output
### Other
Cardiac ischemia, saddle pulmonary embolus, aortic dissection, subclavian steal
