# Anticoagulation Options
#learning
## Xa Inhibitor
Rivaroxaban
Apixaban

## Direct Thrombin Inhibitor (IIa)
Dabigatran

## Vitamin K Antagonist
Warfarin

These drugs suck because:
* narrow therapeutic window
* food and drug interaction
* need for repeated blood tests to monitor

Xa and IIa inhibitors are:
* More effective in preventing several thromboembolic conditions
* have fewer interactions with food or other drugs
* probably have fewer side effects
