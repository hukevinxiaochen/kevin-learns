* Application and Award Requirements:
GHI funds are made available chiefly for primary care, internal medicine, pediatrics, Ob/Gyn rotations, and student research projects in resource-limited settings.  The GHI is committed to offering students opportunities to work with under-served patient populations.  All interested Feinberg medical students and McGaw residents are encouraged to apply.
If you are applying for funds for a rotation at an unaffiliated clinic/hospital, it must be approved by the Center for Global Health first.
If an award is made trainees need to complete a post-program/rotation evaluation and reflection paper within 30 days of returning from the funded trip.  
Students must be registered as a full-time student at the Feinberg School of Medicine (FSM) and be in good standing at the time the student wishes to travel. McGaw residents and fellows are also eligible.
The funds may be used for pre-travel immunizations, visa/passport fees, insurance, airfare, program fees, and room and board related to your global health rotation or research project.  No receipts need be submitted upon returning to Chicago.
III. Funding Restrictions: 
Students may not receive funding from more than one source at Northwestern University or Feinberg School of Medicine, including but not limited to the Feinberg International Health Fellowship, the Feinberg Travel Grant, the Graduate School (MPH Program) or the Office of International Program Development.
Travel funds may not be deferred and must be used for the intended purpose within the same academic year.
Payments to medical students are made through Payroll and the awards are considered taxable income.  Payments to McGaw residents will be as reimbrusements made after travel is complete.  Please contact the Center for Global Health for more details (see email below).
