### What are causes of proteinuria?

Primary:
Minimal change
Membranous nephropathy
FSGS

Secondary:
Diabetes - 10-year long diabetes
Minimal Change - NSAID, Lymphoma, Syphilis
Membranous - Hep B, Solid Tumor, Lupus nephritis
FSGS - HIV, Obesity, Preterm birth (34 weeks cutoff)

_Hematuria_

Micro:
IgA - happens simultaneously with pharyngitis, synpharyngitic
PIGN - 1-6 weeks, low complement (C3, C4)
Thin Basement Membrane - 
Alport’s (Autosomal dominant, deafness) - Type IV collagen defect

Gross:
Urinary tract

_Blood and Protein_
a.k.a. nephritis

Complement Low:
PIGN
MPGN
Cryoglobulinemia
Lupus
Hepatitis

Complement Normal:
IgA
anti-GBM
Vasculitis

Vasculitides:
GPA - saddle nose, sinus, lung disease, c-ANCA
EGPA - eosinophils, granulomas, asthma
MPO - FUO

Vancomycin MIC > 2 is essentially vancomycin resistance
Daptomycin is for MRSA in endocarditis (surfactant deactivates this so it doesn’t work in pneumonia)

### Meningitis treatment?
Ceftriaxone - S. pneumo and N. gonorrhea
Vancomycin - for resistant S. pneumo (changed PBP)
Ampicillin - Listeria
Steroid - Dexamethasone

### In patients with CAP or HAP/VAP and COPD, is there a benefit to the use of an oral steroid regimen?

Steroids have benefit in COPD exacerbations and may have benefit in pneumonia. It only makes sense that they would have benefit in pneumonia in COPD patients… right?

#### Not all COPD exacerbations are due to an infection (though most are), but are all infections of the lung automatically COPD exacerbations?

_A conversation with Dr. Clynes_

Clynes: “Are you using steroids?”
Me: “No, we’re treating pneumonia, but the patient doesn’t have a COPD exacerbation.”
Clynes: “Pneumonia but no COPD exacerbation? That’s a pretty fine distinction you’re making there.”

### In a patient with a suspected soft tissue infection or osteomyelitis, what is the difference in performance of high sensitivity CRP versus CRP?

No difference in the two assays

High sensitivity is much more expensive

13. Should I evaluate for occult cancer in patients with first episode of unprovoked venous thromboembolism?

“Whether patients with a diagnosis of unprovoked venous embolism (VTE) should be evaluated for occult cancer with an extensive or more limited strategy is controversial. In a meta-analysis of 10 prospective studies (over 2000 patients with unprovoked VTE), the prevalence of cancer at one year was 5 percent [2]. Extensive screening, performed in nearly 60 percent of patients, detected more cancer initially than limited evaluation, but the difference was not significant at one year. The effect on long-term mortality is unknown. Until the benefits of extensive evaluation strategies are proven, we suggest evaluating patients with a single episode of unprovoked VTE using a limited strategy (clinical examination, routine laboratory studies, chest radiography, and age-appropriate screening) for the detection of occult cancer.”

17. In brittle diabetics, what is the best approach to glycemic management?
18. What is the reticulocyte production index?
19. In patients with unprovoked venous thromboembolism, does screening for occult malignancy save lives (improve mortality)?
* Meta-analysis
* 10 eligible studies
* 2316 patients
* Mean age 60 years
* Primary outcome: period prevalence at 12 months
* Also: period prevalence between screening and 12 months
* Extensive versus limited screening
	* Extensive - CTAP, PET, ultrasound of abdomen, variable
	* Limited - history, physical, chest x-ray, labs (CBC, BMP, LFTs), age-appropriate screenings (mammography, pap, colonoscopy, PSA)
* Unprovoked VTE is objectively confirmed acute PE or DVT in absence of known cancer, recent surgery, trauma of the leg, immobilization, previous unprovoked VTE, known thrombophilia, pregnancy or puerperium.
* Detected versus diagnosed
	* Detected (2.4 vs 4.5%) for Limited vs Extensive (point prevalence at time of screening)
	* Diagnosed (4.2% vs 5.6%) for Limited vs Extensive (12-month period prevalence)
* Prevalence increased linearly with age 7-fold higher in patients age 50 or older than in younger patients
* Limitations are variations in patients, extensive screening strategies, long-term mortality data
