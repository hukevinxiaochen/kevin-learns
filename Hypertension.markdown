# Hypertension

## Classification
White Coat Hypertension - does not increase risk of cardiovascular disease; prevalence in the ACN

[[Hypertensive Emergency]]
## Screening
### NICE
In the UK

### AHA/ACC and Others
* AAFP is not endorsing because not all recommendations are based on the best RCT-based recommendations and are based on expert opinion synthesis of epidemiologic data
	* But liked focus on BP measurement “Makes helpful suggestions to ensure accurate measurement”
* “Prehypertension” became Stage I Hypertensives

### Out of office BP testing
_Reasons_

* Office BP measurement is inaccurate due to inaccurate methods, limited number of readings, and white coat hypertension effect
* There are alternatives: Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring (ABPM), Home Blood Pressure Monitoring (HBPM)
* Models showed cost-effectiveness and potential savings in the UK — [Cost-effectiveness of options for the diagnosis of high blood pressure in primary care: a modelling study - The Lancet](http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(11)61184-7/abstract)

ABPM data shows that there is a 10% dip overnight in pressures.
ABPM data better predicts cardiovascular disease than office BP.
