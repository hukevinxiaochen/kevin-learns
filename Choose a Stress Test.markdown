## Stress Modalities
### Contraindications to Exercise Stress
* Acute MI
* Ongoing NSTEMI or Unstable Angina
* Uncontrolled arrhythmia with hemodynamic compromise
* Active endocarditis
* Symptomatic Severe aortic stenosis
* Decompensated heart failure
* Acute PE or DVT
* Acute Myocarditis or [[Pericarditis]]
* Acute Aortic Dissection
* Physical Disability that precludes safe and adequate testing

**Relative contraindications**

* Known left main disease
* Moderate aortic stenosis
* Tachyarrhythmia with uncontrolled rates
* Acquired advanced or complete heart block
* Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with severe resting gradient
* Recent stroke or transient ischemic attack
* Resting hypertension > 200/110
* Uncorrected medical conditions such as significant anemia, electrolyte imbalances, and hyperthyroidism

### Pharmacologic Stress
#### Vasodilators
**DO NOT USE** in patients with:
* hypotension < 90 mmHg
* sick sinus syndrome
* high-degree AV block
* reactive airway disease
	* regadenoson may be okay
(Source: UpToDate)

#### Inotropes and Chronotropes
**DO NOT USE** in patients with:
* MI
* Unstable angina
* Severe aortic stenosis
* Atrial tachyarrhythmias
* Ventricular tachycardia (prior history)
* Uncontrolled hypertension (>200/110)
* Aortic dissection
* Large aortic aneurysm
* Patients on beta blockers which would attenuate dobutamine effect
(Source: ASNC via UpToDate)

## Able to exercise to a satisfactory workload?
### No
Pharmacologic Stress
Myocardial imaging
* Echo
* Radionuclide perfusion

## Abnormal baseline EKG?
WPW
Ventricular Paced
LBBB
ST Depression at Rest (> 1 mm)
Digoxin use with associated ST and T abnormalities
LVH with ST and T abnormalities

## Myocardial Viability Assessment Needed?
For example, a patient with multi vessel disease for whom a revascularization strategy is being developed.
