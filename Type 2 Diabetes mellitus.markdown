# Type 2 Diabetes mellitus
**Source** [ADA Standards of Care](https://professional.diabetes.org/content-page/standards-medical-care-diabetes)

## Presentation
Asymptomatic 40% in children, but most are symptomatic

## Terminology
* Type 1 Diabetes mellitus - antibody-positive (98%) evidence of autoimmune-mediated destruction of pancreatic tissue and hence complete loss of insulin secretion ability
* 
## Diagnosis
* 2 tests
	* e.g. A1cs 3 months apart - both above 6.5%

OR 

* 1 test + Symptomatic hyperglycemia
	* polyuria, polyphagia, polydipsia

## Management
### One Time
* PPSV23
### Annual Monitoring
* Microvascular Disease
	* 10-g Monofilament exam for Neuropathy
	* UACR for Nephropathy
	* eGFR for Nephropathy
	* Fundoscopic examination for Retinopathy
* Miscellaneous
	* Visual inspection for ulcers
	* Peripheral pulses for PAD
	* Skin examination for insulin injection site fibrosis
	* B12 to monitor for Metformin-induced B12 deficiency
## Management in Kids
* Nutrition
* Exercise
* Pyschosocial
* Exercise
* Psychosocial
* Prevnar
* Monitor Renal Function
* Initiate Metformin 500 mg per day
* Hypertension > 90 or 95th%-ile on 3 occasions treat with diet & exercise and ACEi

## End-Stage Renal Disease
* Glycemic control is still good.

However:

* Decrease insulin dosage
* Choose medications with hepatic metabolism
* Choose higher A1c goal 7-8
* Monitor glucose levels closely Pre- and Post-dialysis
* Adjust frequently based on metabolic issues and dialysis

### Metabolic Issues
#### Insulin Resistance
Increased with worsening kidney disease
#### Insulin Clearance
Decreased with worsening kidney disease
#### Dialysis
Partially reverses insulin resistance and insulin clearance problems

If peritoneal, the dialysate presents its own increased glucose loaf that will need addressing.
#### Uremia
Carbamylates hemoglobin, which falsely elevates A1c measurements in some assays
#### Anemia
