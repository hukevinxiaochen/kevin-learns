# 2018 European Society of Cardiology Syncope Guidelines
#teaching

## Goals
* Help learners feel comfortable managing patients who lose consciousness or come close to doing so.
## Objectives
* Define syncope.
* Define transient loss of consciousness.
* Define presyncope.
* Appreciate other terms pertaining to syncope and their uncertain significance.
* Find the ESC 2018 Syncope Guidelines.
* Find a list of “Cannot-Miss” EKG findings and diagnoses.
* Interpret various diagnostic maneuvers, tools.

## Lesson Plan

* Syncope is defined as 

### High risk features for syncope
* Major
	* New onset chest discomfort, breathlessness, abdominal pain, headache
	* Syncope during exertion or when supine
	* Sudden onset palpitation immediately followed by syncope
	* Severe structural or coronary artery disease
	* Unexplained systolic BP in ED < 90 mm
	* GI bleed on rectal
	* Persistent bradycardia in awake state and in absence of physical training
	* Undiagnosed systolic murmur
	* Major EKG abnormalities

* Minor
	* No warning or short prodrome
	* Family history of sudden cardiac death at young age
	* Syncope while seated
	* Minor EKG abnormalities

#### EKG abnormalities
* Major
	* Acute ischemia
	* Mobitz II
	* 3rd degree AV block
	* Slow AF < 40 bpm
	* Sinus brady < 40 bpm
	* Sinus pauses > 3 seconds in awake state
	* Bundle branch block
	* Intraventricular conduction disturbance
	* Ventricular hypertrophy
	* Q waves c/w ischemic heart disease or cardiomyopathy
	* Sustained and non-sustained VT
	* Dysfunction of an implantable cardiac device
	* Type 1 Brugada pattern
	* QTc > 460 ms in repeated 12-lead ECG

* Minor
	* Mobitz I
	* 1st degree AV block with markedly prolonged PR
	* Asymptomatic inappropriate mild sinus brady 40-50
	* Paroxysmal SVT or atrial fibrillation
	* Pre-excited QRS complex
	* Short QTc interval < 340 ms
	* Atypical Brugada
	* Negative T waves in right precordial leads, epsilon waves suggestive of ARVC
