# Diabetic Foot Infection
## Should I culture purulent drainage from a foot ulcer to help guide treatment?
**Source**: IDSA 2012

We recommend sending a specimen for culture that is from deep tissue, obtained by biopsy or curettage after the wound has been cleansed and debrided. We suggest avoiding swab specimens, especially of inadequately debrided wounds, as they provide less accurate results (strong, moderate).
