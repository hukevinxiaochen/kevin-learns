* Adolescent Clinic at 21 Audubon 1-212-342-3215 Betsy Pfeffer bp35@columbia.edu 9:30 - 5 PM
* Young Men's Clinic at 21 Audubon Avenue, first floor, phone is 342-3209.  The director is Dr. David Bell, but you will also be working with Dr. Silvia Amesty, a family physician who is affiliated with our residency.  The Friday afternoon clinic typically begins at 1 pm. Introduce yourself to both Dr. Bell and Dr. Amesty when you arrive. You can view their tallies on Soarian by setting department to Young Mens Clinic (YMC) and selecting their names from the list provided under resource, however there are often multiple walk-ins and pre-reading may be less helpful during this session. 
* Outpatient Peds is also located at 21 Audubon, but on the second floor, phone 342-3218.  Your preceptor is Dr. Connis Kostacos.  Her email is chk11@columbia.edu and her cell is 917-733-5347.  The have created a separate tally for us, so please contact the site if you are out, as they will need to reschedule those patients asap or we will need to use our own sick call to cover the tally.  When you arrive, wait in the conference room for Dr Kostaco; it is the last door on the left.  You are scheduled to see 3 patients per session, and pre-reading is recommended. During each WCC, parents should also be given a TIPP sheet (for injury prevention, these are colored sheets located in file folders within each room), and verbal or written anticipatory guidance.  You may have your own tally in Sorian which you can access by setting your location to 21 Audubon (OCAUDB), and your resource to Audubon Fam Medicine Resident (OCA836FAMRES).  However, if you don't see a tally, please show up any way as you will be assigned walk ins or assist another provider.  When Dr Kostacos is out, she will assign another attending to supervise your session.  Please don't leave the session early, unless you are formally discharged by Dr. Kostacos or the attending in charge. 
* Developmental Peds will take place at Columbia University Head Start which is located at 4467 Broadway at 192nd Street. You can take either the 1 or A train, and go through the tunnel, not the elevator, at either stop. There is no sign outside HeadStart, it is the entrance next to the Deal Dollar Store. The phone is 212-923-5237. Please arrive at 9 am and ask for Katharine Mora. Each morning session will be spent observing children in a different age group: infants, toddlers, 3 yo and 4 yo. The goals for this experience is to learn what normal development and what abnormal development is for each of the above age groups, and when to refer for early intervention (EI). This is largely a self taught experience so please refer to the following CDC website for normal developmental milestones as well as red flags: http://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/actearly/milestones/index.html before you arrive so you know what you should be observing. Katharine Mora will be available to help orient you and answer any questions--she will also point out children who are not meeting milestones so you can understand the developmental differences.   Katharine's email is kom2104@columbia.edu if you need to reach her. Wifi password for HeadStart-Guest WiFi is `Head Start!`
