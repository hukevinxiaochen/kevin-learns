# Abdominal Pain Acute Pediatric
#learning/pediatric

**Source** Pediatrics in Review, AAP

## Location and Nature
### Visceral
* In hollow viscous/organ wall
* Poorly localized
* Stretch-responsive
* Dull
* Diffuse
* Cramping
* Burning
* Prompts movement in attempts to decrease pain

**Autonomic nerves**
* Sweating
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Pallor
* Anxiety

**3 Broad Areas of Localization**
* Epigastric - stomach, lower esophagus, duodenum, hepatobiliary, pancreatic
* Umbilical - small intestine
* Lower abdomen - colon

### Somatoparietal
* Stretch-responsive
* Better localized
* Sharp
* Movement usually worsens the pain so may cause the child to stay still or splint when walking

### Referred
* Diaphragmatic irritation manifests in shoulder or lower neck

## History
### Characteristics of Emesis
* Bilious - Obstruction, Midgut volvulus

### Appearance of Stool
* Watery diarrhea 

## Major Pediatric Entities
### Small Bowel Volvulus a.k.a. Midgut Volvulus a.k.a. Malrotation

Epidemiology
* Children younger than 1 year of age

Etiology
* Incomplete rotation of embryonic bowel aka malrotation

Presentation
* Bilious emesis
* Pain evolving dull to sharp
* Obstruction —> Acute Abdomen
* Late sign of rectal bleeding

Diagnostic
* Dilate stomach and proximal duodenum on plain radiograph
* Upper GI Contrast Study

Treatment
* Untwist the bowel

### Intussusception

Epidemiology
* Most frequent cause of intestinal obstruction in children
* Most common site at terminal ileum
* Lead point: tumor, polyp, Meckel diverticulum, hypertrophic Peyer’s patch following viral infection
* Presents more likely in infants

Presentation
* Currant jelly stool (vascular compromise)
* Umbilical, right lower quadrant

Diagnosis
* Palpable sausage-shaped mass
* Ultrasound

Treatment
* Air contrast enema
* Surgery

### Henoch-Schonlein Purpurs
Definition
* Vasculitis

Epidemiology
* Rare in infants
* But less than 10 years of age
* HSP recurs 1/3 of the time

Pathophysiology
* Vasculitis triggered by infection, medication, insect bites
* Purpuric lesions develop in the intestines
* Lesions can bleed or cause intussusception 

Presentation
* Rash on buttocks or extensor surface of legs starting as urticaria progressing palpable purpora

### Constipation

Presentation
* Palpable mass
* Distention

### Pneumonia

Lower lobe pneumonia can present as abdominal pain due to visceral innervation and poor localization

### Streptococcal pharyngitis

Why? Nobody knows.

### DKA

Why? Dunno
