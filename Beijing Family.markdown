#reflections

This was my first time back to Beijing in 10 years. The purpose of the trip was to see family and friends. So here’s an overview as told through photos taken and people seen.

## Grandma/Lao Lao
She’s lived in Beijing nearly all her life. 98 going on 99 - this woman is the center of the universe for her 7 children who now live in Hong Kong, Mainland China, and the United States of America.
