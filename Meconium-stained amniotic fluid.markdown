“A common cause of neonatal respiratory pathology characterized by in utero or perinatal aspiration of meconium-stained amniotic fluid (MSAF) that causes respiratory distress.”

13% of all deliveries associated with meconium-stained amniotic fluid (MSAF)
5-12% of neonates delivered through MSAF develop meconium aspiration syndrome (MAS)
Passage of meconium seldom occurs prior to 34 weeks gestation, occurs usually in term and late-term infants, is related to fetal distress, which leads to hypoxia-induced vagal response causing passage of meconium.
