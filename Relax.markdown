December 16, 2017

I am sitting on the 5 train. It is moving downtown. I’m wearing a hat. I have with me a large blue bag. The intention of my trip is to pick up packages. I have a lot on my mind. A series of tasks to prioritize and schedule. Some work. Some life.

I’m feeling guilty, anxious, tired, afraid, and confused.

I feel this way because I am afraid of not upholding my responsibilities, of letting promises and obligations go unfulfilled. I want to be a person who says what they mean, who means what they say, reliable, dependable. I want to do my part - not let people down.

I am only one person. My options are to rest and relax or to engage in listing and prioritization. I should do a combination of both. Urgent concerns first. Then rest. Then less urgent concerns. It is okay to rest and relax.
