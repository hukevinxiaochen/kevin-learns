# Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) 
#learning

## Diagnosis
### Suspect
12 million estimated (NHANES) to be undiagnosed
12 million carrying diagnosis

* Former smokers
* Exposures
* Symptomatic
	* Breathlessness
	* Cough with sputum
	* Recurrent bronchitis requiring antibiotics

### Bronchitis
Lower respiratory tract infection of large airways without pneumonia, without COPD usually caused by a virus.

#### Diagnosis
* Cough for 5 days
* No pneumonia
* No COPD

#### Treatment
No antibiotics

### Exacerbation

“An acute worsening of respiratory symptoms that results in additional therapy.” - [Pocket Guide to COPD Diagnosis, Management, and Prevention - 2017 - Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease - GOLD](http://goldcopd.org/pocket-guide-copd-diagnosis-management-prevention-2016/)

Prior admission for exacerbation is strongest predictor for future exacerbation - more so than active smoking even, white count, CRP

#### Manifestations
Increases in:

- [ ] Cough
- [ ] Dyspnea
- [ ] Sputum Production
- [ ] Sputum Purulence

## Prognosis
In critically ill patients with community acquired pneumonia, having underlying COPD is a associated with higher mortality rates.

## Treatment
* Pulmonary rehabilitation has multidimensional benefits in COPD management, including improved exercise tolerance, quality of life, and mood. Aerobic exercise improves muscle mass, with high-intensity exercise proving more efficacious than low-intensity exercise. 
* According to Global Initiative for Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) guidelines, an inhaled corticosteroid should be added for frequent exacerbations and an FEV1 <50%. Although it is possible that a combined long-acting   -agonist (LABA)/corticosteroid would improve dyspnea more than a LABA alone, the benefit would not likely be more than a pulmonary rehabilitation program. 
* Switching from formoterol to tiotropium would not be expected to provide a significant benefit, and the benefits of adding a LABA to tiotropium have not been studied. 
* Third-party payers restrict payment for oxygen therapy to those with an SaO2 <89%, a PaO2 <55 mm Hg, a hematocrit >55%, or documented cor pulmonale.**Sources** Ref: Niewoehner DE: Outpatient management of severe COPD.
