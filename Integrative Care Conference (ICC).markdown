1. Invite 3 patients - usually you give Ileana the names of your patients you scheduled so she can add them to your ICC tally. Depending on how many open slots you have now (1-3), you can invite your patients.
2. Usually, one needs to give Ileana the names of the patients the Thursday before your ICC time. If she does not receive any names from you, she will open your tally for walk-ins the Friday morning before your ICC time.
3. Invite any patient with any kind of problem (diabetes, child-parent, depression, heart disease, confusing family situation, troublesome doctor/patient relationship), any patient that you believe you and the patient could benefit by further exploration of the patient's health situation with a multidisciplinary team.
4. Invite the patient to invite one or more family members to join the meeting.
