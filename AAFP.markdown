## Opening
### Manisha Sharma, MD
* Wanted to be unapologetic about mission
* Wanted to change the system that was trying to break me

### Sachin H Jain, MD
* Academic centers really didn’t want to change
* Went to Veteran’s Administration instead
* CareMore CMO to CEO
* Risks: Join a startup practice, working in Govt
* House calls / an app (2000 of the sickest dual eligible patients with frequent bounce backs)
* Advantage of being both the health plan and the provider
* Average day in the hospital: $2500-4000 

### Jay Lee, MD
* Understand self
* Show up
* Family physicians look to go upstream
* Occupying the ground - getting good at something and not giving up, making an impact
* We’ve abdicated the moral responsibility to lead the system

### Rushika Fernandopulle, MD
* Last time I checked, a transaction never healed anyone - relationships heal people
