# Definition
* Sepsis:

	- [ ] life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection
	- [ ] Among patients with suspected infection a SOFA ≥ 2 or qSOFA or deltaSOFA.

* Septic Shock:

	- [ ] vasopressors needed to maintain MAP ≥ 65 mmHg

_Rationale_: Singer et al., “The Third International Consensus Definitions for Sepsis and Septic Shock (Sepsis-3).”

Among non-ICU encounters in the validation cohort (n = 66 522 with suspected infection, of whom 1886 [3%] died).
- qSOFA had predictive validity (AUROC = 0.81; 95% CI, 0.80-0.82) that was greater than
- SOFA (AUROC = 0.79; 95% CI, 0.78-0.80; P < .001)
- SIRS (AUROC = 0.76; 95% CI, 0.75-0.77; P < .001)

Predictive validity analyzed in terms of in-hospital mortality and in-hospital mortality or intensive care unit [ICU] length of stay ≥3 days.

# Clinical Definitions
## quick Sequential Organ Failure Assessment Score - qSOFA
- score of 2 or greater associated with 10% in-hospital mortality

# SOFA
qSOFA = likely to die of suspected infection/prolonged ICU stay

## SOFA
* resp
* renal
* hepatic
* CV
* Heme
* Neuro

# Diagnosis
A limitation of the definitions above = cannot identify patients whose organ dysfunction is truly secondary to an underlying infection.

Therefore, a constellation of clinical, laboratory, radiologic, physiologic, and microbiologic data is required for a diagnosis of sepsis or septic shock.

# Management
Look for infection in organ failure. Look for organ failure in infection.

* history taking
* physical exam
* early resuscitation
* order labs
* early broad spectrum antibiotics
* source control
* fluids (greater than 30 mL/kg) within first 3 hours
