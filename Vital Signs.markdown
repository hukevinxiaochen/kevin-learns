**Disclaimer** The actual methodology of data acquisition and determination of normal is pretty difficult to drill down for vital signs so treat all these references as rough guides and not as some sort of gospel. It is just wisdom passed down through the years. It will keep your head on straight when youâ€™re triaging your patients - and that is good enough for now.
