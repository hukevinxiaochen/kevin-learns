## Reflect
> What if your work did not tell you how to live?  
> What to wear?  
> What language to use?  
> How to behave towards others?  
> What to read?  
> When to eat?  
> Or how much to sleep?  
> What if your work was simply an opportunity for you to express your highest values into this world?  
> What would your work look like then?  
> Where would you be doing your work?  
> What would your relationships with your patients be like?
