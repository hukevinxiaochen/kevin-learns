General thoughts: Thanks Hyo!

My 2 cents from the onboarding intern perspective:

# Major time wasters
- [ ] having more places to look for information than it is feasible for someone to look
- [ ] lack of access to information
- [ ] stale/old out-of-date information

# Major time savers
- [ ] search
- [ ] information hierarchy
- [ ] just-in-time updates
