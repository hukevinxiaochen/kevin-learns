# Ventilation
#learning/surgery

## Background
* 20-30%

## Lung Physiology
* Optimize Pressure (PEEP) and Volume (Tidal Volume)

## Ventilation Strategies
* Conventional - thought to damage alveoli due to high tidal volumes (12 mL/kg)
* Lung Protective - reduces mortality in patients with ARDS; best practice in critically ill patients (TV = 6 mL/kg, PEEP above lower inflection point on static pressure-volume curve)

## A Trial of Intraoperative Low-Tidal-Volume Ventilation in Abdominal Surgery
* 2013, NEJM
* Multi-center, Double-blinded, French teaching hospitals
* Included patients over 40, over 2 hours operating time (significant abdominal procedure); pulmonary risk index of 2 or greater
* Excluded recently ventilated patients, hx of respiratory failure
* 400 patients
* Conventional - 10-12 mL/kg
* Lung Protective - 6-8 mL/kg, PEEP of 6 to 8 cm of water
* Recruitment maneuvers - raise PEEP temporarily? as needed
* Higher rates of post-op complications with conventional ventilation compared to lung-protective ventilation
