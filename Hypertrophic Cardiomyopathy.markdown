## Basics
1 in 500
## Pathophysiology
* Usually asymmetric, sometimes global LVH, apical variant
* LV contractile function vigorous
* LVH —> Angina, Dyspnea
* Stiff ventricle —> High diastolic pressures
* Short, wide, hypertrophied fibers —> Associated arrhythmias —> Syncope and Sudden Death

### Outflow tract obstruction
The process is explained as follows: (1) during ventricular contraction, ejection of blood toward the aortic valve is more rapid than usual, because it must ﬂow through an outﬂow tract that is narrowed by the thickened septum; (2) this rapid ﬂow creates Venturi forces that abnormally draw the anterior mitral leaﬂet toward the septum during contraction; and (3) the anterior mitral leaﬂet approaches and abuts the hypertrophied septum, causing transient obstruction of blood ﬂow into the aorta.

Situations that decrease LV cavity size (e.g., reduced venous return because of intravascular volume depletion) bring the mitral leaﬂet and septum into closer proximity and promote obstruction.

Conversely, conditions that enlarge the LV (e.g., augmented intravascular volume) increase the distance between the anterior mitral leaﬂet and septum and reduce the obstruction.

Positive inotropic drugs (which augment the force of contraction) also force the mitral leaﬂet and septum into closer proximity and contribute to obstruction, whereas negative inotropic drugs (e.g., Beta-blockers, verapamil) have the opposite effect.

## Clinical Manifestations
### Syncope
* From arrhythmias
* In patients with outﬂow tract obstruction, syncope may also be induced by exertion, when the pressure gradient is made worse by the increased force of contraction, thereby causing a transient fall in cardiac output.
* Orthostatic lightheadedness is also common in patients with outﬂow tract obstruction.
### Arrhythmias

## Genetics of Pediatric Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy
### Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with Lactic Acidosis Discovered by Whole Exome Sequencing
* Affected 3 of 5 children born to parents who were completely normal.
* Autosomal recessive pattern
* Found to have GTPBP3 Val121Gly variant with high CADD score (24.1) predicts damage (SIFT and PolyPhen2)
* Used as “normal” : 1000 Genomes 0, ESP 0 (Normal background population)
* Variant corresponds to a mitochondrial GTP binding protein 3 that may play a role in mitochondrial tRNA modification
* Only novel variant not seen before in public databases fitting aggregate pattern
