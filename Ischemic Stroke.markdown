# Ischemic Stroke
[[Stroke]]

Following an ischemic stroke, anti-platelet therapy is an important component of secondary prevention. This is in addition to optimizing management for comorbid diseases such as hypertension, diabetes, tobacco use, lipid derangements, atrial fibrillation, and carotid artery stenosis.

	* Intracranial large vessel (MCA)

## Embolism
* Known Cardiac and/or Aortic

# Secondary Prevention
Anti-hypertensives
Anti-thrombotic therapy or anti-platelet therapy
Statin
Lifestyle modification
Symptomatic internal carotid artery disease may benefit from revascularization
