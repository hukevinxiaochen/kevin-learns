## Possible
Assess pre-test probability to decide whether to screen with stress

## Stable
### Suspected
- [ ] History
- [ ] Physical
- [ ] EKG
- [ ] Stress Test

### Confirmed
- [ ] Beta blockers for symptoms
	- [ ] CCBs and Nitrates second line
- [ ] Aspirin
- [ ] Statin ([Statin Benefits](https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/902217))
- [ ] Smoking cessation
- [ ] BP control
- [ ] Weight loss plan
- [ ] Exercise plan
- [ ] Management of diabetes

### Follow Up
- [ ] History
- [ ] Physical
- [ ] EKG

## Unstable
### NSTEMI
### STEMI
* Elevations in V2 and V3 should exceed 1.5 mm in women, 2 mm in men over age 40 and 2.5 mm in men less than age 40 (U World)
* Localize the MI
	* If inferior, avoid Nitroglycerin
	* If hypotensive s/p Nitroglycerin suspect RVMI and optimize preload by:
		* Bolusing fluids
* Call Cardiology for PCI

## In Women
* Chest pain is still common presentation
* 40-50% of women catheterized have no significant coronary disease
