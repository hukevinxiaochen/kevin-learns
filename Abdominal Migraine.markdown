## Background
### Chronic abdominal pain
* Prolonged
* Waxing and waning
* Good days and bad days
* Seldom completely absent
* e.g. IBD or nerve root irritation in tuberculous spinal disease

### Recurrent Abdominal Pain
* Clear-cut symptom free intervals

### Periodic Syndrome
* 1933 Wyllie and Schlesinger introduced the term to describe recurrent episodes of pyrexia, headache vomiting and abdominal pain
* In Australia Cullen and MacDonald noted that the periodic syndrome frequently occurred in children with a family history of migraine
* In Boston, Barlow confirmed that the periodic syndrome was a common childhood precursor of adult migraine
* Electrophysiological changes in migraine also occur in periodic syndrome
* Strong support for existence of migrainous syndrome in children with abdominal pain as important feature
* There is weak support, however, for the notion that adults - according to Blau and MacGregor - experience abdominal migraine. Only 1 in 100 adult patients with migraine had abdominal pains during attacks.

## Epidemiology
* Prevalence peaks at 10 years of age
* A recent study found that it persists into late teens in over one-third of cases
* concurrent abdominal pain with migraine headache occurs
* children with episodic abdominal pain and children with migraine headaches share demographic features
* episodic abdominal pain is treated by migraine therapy
* neurophysiological features

## Features
* episodic
* general malaise, nausea, and vomiting +/- migraine headache
* Family History of Migraine

## Diagnosis
### Differential for Recurrent Abdominal Pain
* GERD
* IBS
* H. Pylori infection
* Nonspecific motility disorders
* Munchausen syndrome by proxy
* Lactose malabsorption
* Migraine
