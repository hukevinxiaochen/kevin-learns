* Patient volume high
* Rounds are slow
	* Culture is slow and philosophical pace - no commitment to structure
	* Mixed Attending buy-in
	* Attendings not always prepared
* Long commute
* Different seniors and philosophies

## Solutions
* Make a schedule
* Make a must-cover topic list
* Only exemption from didactics is clinic
