* How can I help myself?
* Am I hungry, angry, lonely, or tired?
* If so, why? If not, why?
* What am I doing right now?
* How is Erica doing? Mom? Mei Mei? My Other Family and Friends? My Community?
* What mindset can I adopt, which would help me and those around me in need?
* Remember to always Relax, Smile, and Spread Love. Keep an Empty sink, and wipe the countertops.
