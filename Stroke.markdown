* Clopidogrel and Aspirin for Acute Ischemic Stroke and High-Risk TIA in the Platelet-Oriented Inhibition in New TIA and Minor Ischemic Stroke trial (POINT)
	* Goal of the paper is to add to the conversation in the wake of the CHANCE trial, which was only done in the Chinese population and demonstrated reduced risk of stroke with aspirin and clopidogrel without increased risk of hemorrhagic complication.
	* Background
		* Risk of ischemic stroke ranges from 3 to 15% in the 90 days after a minor ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack.
		* Clopidogrel blocks platelet aggregation through the P2Y12-receptor pathway, a mechanism that is synergistic with aspirin in platelet-aggregation assays.
			* The two-drug combination of Aspirin and Clopidogrel has been more effective than aspirin alone  in reducing the risk of ischemic events in patients with acute coronary syndrome.
	* High-Risk TIA - ABCD2 score 4 or more
	* Minor Ischemic Stroke - NIHSS score 3 or less
	* Major Hemorrhage - symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage, intraocular bleeding causing vision loss, transfusion of 2 or more units of pRBC or whole blood; hospitalization, prolongation of existing hospitalization or death due to hemorrhage.
	* Intervention: 600-mg loading dose of clopidogrel + 75 mg per day from day 2 to day 90 and aspirin 50 to 325 mg
	* Control: Placebo matched in taste and appearance + same range of aspirin
	* Recommended aspirin was 161 mg for 5 days followed by 81 mg daily per guidelines (AHA and ASA Guidelines)
	* Primary Outcome was a composite of ischemic stroke, myocardial infarction, or death from an ischemic vascular event at 90 days.
	* Safety Outcome was Major hemorrhage defined 
	* Strengths
		* 269 International Sites helps with external validity
* Thrombectomy 6 to 24 Hours after Stroke with a Mismatch between Deficit and Infarct (DAWN Trial)
	* Endovascular thrombectomy - removal of thrombus using the Trevo device
	* Patients enrolled had
		* occlusion of intracranial ICA, or proximal MCA with last known well 6 to 24 hours earlier
		* Mismatch between severity of deficit and infarct volume
			* Group A: 80 or older, NIHSS 10 or higher, infarct volume less than 21 mL
			* Group B: Younger than 80, NIHSS 10 or higher, infarct volume less than 31 mL
			* Group C: Younger than 80, NIHSS 20 or higher, infarct volume 31 to less than 51 mL
			* Infarct volume estimated by DWI or Perfusion CT, used RAPID, iSchemaView
	* Primary Endpoint was the utility-weight modified Rankin score which ranges from 0 (death) to 10 (no disability)
	* A second Primary endpoint was rate of functional independence 0, 1, or 2 on modified Rankin scale at 90 days
		* changed to co-primary at request of FDA
	* Safety endpoint was stroke-related death a 90 days
	* Thrombectomy and Standard Care versus Standard Care alone
	* Strengths
	* Weaknesses
		* Funding by Stryker Neurovascular leads to higher likelihood of unreliable data, false reporting.
		* Lack of sham control leads to exaggeration of effect size difference.
	* Concludes that thrombectomy in patients 6 to 24 hours from last known normal with proximal MCA or intracranial ICA stroke would benefit from thrombectomy if their NIHSS is greater than 10 and infarct volume is less than a certain threshold.
* Network meta-analysis of patent foramen ovale management strategies in cryptogenic stroke
	* To compare the outcomes of patent foramen ovale (PFO) closure vs antiplatelet agent (APA) vs oral anticoagulation therapy (OAT) for secondary prevention of stroke in patients with cryptogenic stroke, using direct and indirect evidence from existing randomized data.
	* The eﬃcacy outcome was stroke recurrence, and safety outcomes were atrial ﬁbrillation and bleeding complications at the end of follow-up.
	* Bayesian network meta-analysis performed to calculate:
		* risk estimates
		* rank probabilities
	* The results demonstrated lower rates of recurrent stroke in association with PFO closure and or oral anticoagulation therapy, each with atrial fibrillation and bleeding as complications.
* Restenosis and risk of stroke after stenting of endarterectomy for symptomatic carotid stenosis in the International Carotid Stenting Study (ICSS)-secondary analysis of randomized trial
* Safety and Efficacy of a 3-Dimensional Stent Retriever With Aspiration-Based Thrombectomy vs Aspiration-Based Thrombectomy Alone in Acute Ischemic Stroke Intervention:  A Randomized Clinical Trial
* The efficacy and safety of high-dose statins in acute phase of ischemic stroke and transient ischemic stroke:  a systematic review
* Temporal trends in early case-fatality rates in patients with intracerebral hemorrhage
* Sex differences in the evaluation and treatment of acute ischaemic stroke
* Stroke Policy
## Key Concepts
* POINT and CHANCE have shown us  that patients with minor strokes and TIAs can have reduced risk of major ischemic events with higher hemorrhagic event risk when taking both clopidogrel and aspirin in the first 90 days post-event.
	* CHANCE had fewer hemorrhagic events, likely because they limited the period of using both drugs to the first 21 days.
* DAWN trial concludes that it is a good idea (more functional independence) to proceed to thrombectomy in patients 6 to 24 hours from last known normal with proximal MCA or intracranial ICA stroke would benefit from thrombectomy if their NIHSS is greater than 10 and infarct volume is less than a certain threshold.
