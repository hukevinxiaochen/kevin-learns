## Phase 1
### Colustrum
* Production begins in 2nd Tri
* Breast enlargement
* Montgomery Tubercles
* Areolar enlargement
* 5-10 ducts
* Includes
	* High protein (i.e. all the immunoglobulins)
		* IgM, IgA (Improves immune response to upper respiratory and gastrointestinal pathogens)

### Milk
* High calorie
* Fat
* Water
* Lactoferrin - helps bind Fe, which prevents pathogen scavenging
* Epidermal growth factor
* Carnitine - lipolysis co-factor
* EPO
* Insulin
* Prostaglandins
* Lactase or Lipase? (not initially made by newborns in large quantities)

### Changes in Breast Milk Composition
* Foremilk - hydration 1-2% fat, first 5 minutes
* Hindmilk - feeding 5-6% fat, first 
* Gluten - depends on maternal diet

## Phase 2 - Lactogenesis
* Day 5 after Birthday
* Corresponds to dip of progesterone and estrogen
* Etiologies: high cortisol, PCOS, Sheehan syndrome, pre-pregnancy obesity

## Benefits of Breastmilk
* First 1-2 years - less likely to get otitis media and diarrheal illness

* Lower risk of breast and ovarian cancer
* Decreases stress hormone levels

## Contraindications
* HAART

	* bad: pain, nipple shape change
* repeat attachment attempts until successful

## Common Questions
