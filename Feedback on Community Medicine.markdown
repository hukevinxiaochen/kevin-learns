# Feedback on Community Medicine
ANONYMOUS FEEDBACK:
-heads up earlier about charla project and about the IRB
----this might improve buy-in instead of feeling pushed into something without warning 
-BETTER FIRST DAY BRIEFING WITH OBJECTIVES
---consider formatting it using a high yield ppt instead of a long verbal thing by softness 

-lack of agenda, disparate activities, not enough time to accomplish all the tasks they were directed to accomplish.
specifically two Charla orientation sessions felt too "off the cuff" (clarify goals and objectives of each of the activities as well as overall)
-"unacceptable" to find out about the month a week before (provide more advance notice regarding schedule) 

-"drawn in many directions"
-consider giving on first day a checklist
(literal checklist)
**aware that some things are not able to be scheduled or quantified in checklist, but whatever is (esp schedule-wise) should be**
-natalie stats talk: wasn't made clear that this lecture was to be used for basic general info AS IN WHEN READING A PAPER IN A JOURNAL
---evident that she tried hard but goal wasn't accomplished 
---some parts were obtuse even to those who DO have copious stats experience
---consider title of: "how to read an article" 
---all questions or feedback directed to Natalie result in her responding defensively
-i didn't know in advance what i'd be getting out of this month but i think that that's ok, also it would be different for each person,
HOWEVER having more of a context, roadmap, would be better 

-this month was why i wanted to come to this program 
-it was busy and a a little chaotic, but at same time did give me a chance to breathe (compared to other rotations) and reflect overall - though the planned activities of the month didn't specifically aid in reflection, month overall did connect me more to why i wanted to be family doctor 
-spanish classes good but could be tailored to varying levels better
-more ana esteban 
-have planned activities where interns have to go to neighborhood location and only speak spanish, simply initiating conversations rather than formal needs assessment
-give interns a couple of TOTALLY FREE wellness half days or full days 
-can present list of books to share (not required reading) 
-consider return to true COPC model so that interns may truly partner with community organization
-charla project SHOULD be continued but the whole thing and the charla material/script should be introduced at orientation in June orientation as an FYI, possibly even allow them to choose which charla topic to do to improve buy in
---this would also allow REHEARSAL of speaking spanish for non spanish speaking interns (could even use R3P friday morning meetings to rehearse) 
--asking non-spanish speaking residents to deliver charlas felt insulting to the pts / doing disservice to the pts 
-also tell them in advance (in June) about the assigned book 
-if had to get rid of one thing would be stats lecture 
-spanish too passive in closed boring room, should be active 

"of course there is always room for improvement; nothing is perfect and we have to pick our battles. 
But we already have the foundation, and that is us. 
I hate feelings. Don't repeat this.
While constant positivity may be annoying, by that same token whining is unproductive."
