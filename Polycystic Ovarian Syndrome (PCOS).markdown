> (Panel A) Functional ovarian hyperandrogenism (FOH) is nearly universal in PCOS and can account for all the cardinal clinical features of the syndrome: Hyperandrogenemia, oligo-anovulation, and polycystic ovaries (step 1). Pituitary LH secretion is necessary to sustain the ovarian androgen excess, but is not sufficient to cause it.  
> (Panel B) About one-half of patients with FOH have an abnormal degree of insulin-resistant hyperinsulinism (step 2). Insulin-resistant hyperinsulinism acts on theca cells to aggravate hyperandrogenism, synergizes with androgen to prematurely luteinize granulosa cells, and stimulates fat accumulation. The increased hyperandrogenemia provokes LH excess, which then acts on both theca and luteinized granulosa cells to worsen hyperandrogenism (step 3). LH also stimulates luteinized granulosa cells to secrete estradiol (step 4), which suppresses FSH secretion. These hyperinsulinism-initiated changes in granulosa cell function further exacerbate polycystic ovary morphology (PCOM) and further hinder ovulation. Obesity increases insulin-resistance, and the resultant increased hyperinsulinism further aggravates hyperandrogenism (step 5). Bold and enlarged fonts represent greater severity.  
> Both FOH and insulin resistance typically have an intrinsic basis. This model does not exclude the possibility that the unknown intrinsic ovarian defects that underpin the ovarian steroidogenic dysfunction also involve granulosa cell folliculogenesis and other systems as well. The figure also does not depict other associated defects, such as the functional adrenal hyperandrogenism that often accompanies the ovarian hyperandrogenism and the contribution of excess adiposity to peripheral androgen production and gonadotropin suppression.

### Primary Functional Ovarian Hyperandrogenism
* Excess androgen production by ovary
* Androgens act on skin, ovarian granulosa cells:
	* In skin, they affect the pilosebaceous unit. This promotes hair growth, and the clinical manifestation we call hirsutism
	* In the ovary, they affect granulosa cells. This leads to dysfunction that causes oligo-anovulation and polycystic ovary morphology.
		* Specifically, androgen excess stimulates and abnormally large number of small follicles to grow. Furthermore, it promotes premature luteinization of granulosa cells at the mid-follicular phase, i.e. at the large antral stage of development - which is probably the basis for maturation arrest at this stage. It follows from this state that a dominant follicle fails to emerge, hence anovulation and the clinical manifestation we know as oligo-amenorrhea.
* Downstream, anovulation deprives the endometrium of normal post-ovulatory progesterone secretion. This deprivation leads to relatively more unopposed estrogen exposure in PCOS patients when compared to regularly ovulating population, which leads to increased incidence of endometrial cancer.

## Clinical Manifestations
### Oligomenorrhea
* Fewer than 9 menstrual periods in 1 year

### Amenorrhea
* No menstrual periods for 3 or more months

### Hyperandrogenism
#### Hirsutism
* Hair
* Thick
* Pigmented
* Upper lip, chin, periareolar, mid sternum, linea alba
* Varies with ethnicity

#### Male-pattern baldness

#### Deepening voice
#### Clitoromegaly

### Metabolic Issues
See [[Metabolic Syndrome and Obesity Related Disease]]

## Differential
* Nonclassic congenital adrenal hyperplasia
* Thyroid disease
* Hyperprolactinemia

### If hyperandrogenism is severe then…
* Androgen-secreting ovarian and adrenal tumors
* Ovarian hyperthecosis

## Diagnosis
### Rotterdam Criteria
2 of the following 3

* Oligo- and /or anovulation
* Clinical and/or biochemical hyperandrogenism
* Polycystic ovary by ultrasound

### Suspect when a woman presents with any of the following
* irregular menses in adolescence
* hyperandrogenism: acne, hirsutism, or male-pattern hair loss
* in adolescence

#### Be even more suspicious when
* obesity	

### DO NOT suspect
* polycystic ovary morphology on ultrasound alone

### Less likely
* new irregular menses at age greater than 30

### Evaluate with
* Serum androgen levels
	* Total testosterone by LC-MS
* Morning 17-hydroxyprogesterone
* hCG
* Prolactin
* TSH
* FSH

## Treatment
### Weight Loss
### Oral Contraceptives
### Spironolactone at 6 months
### Intermittent Progestin Therapy
### Clomiphene Citrate
### Letrozole
