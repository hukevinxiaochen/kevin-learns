## Terms
DAA - Direct Acting Antiretrovirals

## Conference - NYCDOH sponsored Clinical Education Initiative
* HIV is CV Risk factor, but smoking_hypertension_cholesterol still mainstay 
* Bictegravir - new integrase inhibitor
* Dolutegravir - still works great
* Maintenance - NNRTI + Integrase Inhibitor - evidence base exists
* TAF is safer pro-drug version of Tenofovir compared to TDF (which has significant renal toxicity concerns)
* HIV Prevention works: PrEP and TasP
* PrEP - sufficient prevention can be achieved with 4 times a week for anal exposure and 6-7 for vaginal exposure
* PrEP does not appear to increase risky behavior
* Multi-site STI Screening is important

## Hepatitis C
* Drugs are so damn expensive

### Epidemiology

_About Viral Hepatitis_
* Similar to TB
* Higher incidence than HIV

_HCV Specifically_
* 71 million living with HCV globally
* Driven by contact with medical system and by IV drug use

_Mortality_
* Increased 3 fold in last decade
* Cause of death is cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma

_Microbiology_
* Genotype 1 predominates

_Transmission_
* Bimodal distribution by age
* Baby boomers (Adults born before 45-65 according to USPSTF)
* Young IV drug users (new)

_Natural History_
* 20% of patients self-clear, attain SVR with their own immune systems

### Screening
* Antibodies
* Quantitative RNA

#### Indications for testing

_One-time testing_
* Offer to any patient born between 1945 and 1965 (USPSTF Grade B)
	* USPSTF Grade B - offer Hepatitis C virus screening
* Anyone who received blood transfusion before 1992
* Unexplained transaminase elevations

_Repeat Testing_
* IV drug use
* Intranasal drug use
* MSM with HIV and high risk
* Other risk
	* Candidates for hemodialysis	
* Incarcerated
* Unregulated tattoo

### Pre-Testing Treatment
#### Genotype

There are pan-genotype regimens, but knowing genotype can influence:
* payment
* length of treatment
* specific regimens:

GT1a for elbasvir/grazoprevir
GT3 cirrhosis for solosbuvir/velpatasvir
G/P treatment experienced GT3

#### Cirrhosis - is it present? Stage Liver Disease

In the DAA-era, the reason to stage someone is to simply know whether they have severe damage or not (back in the day it mattered to stage fibrosis). Severe damage (F3-F4) is often an indication for longer duration of treatment.

Cirrhosis matters because it means elevated risk of decompensation and liver cancer.

* Biopsy
* Imaging
	* US is not helpful for liver fibrosis no matter the radiologist comments
		* Exceptions: nodularity with enlarged caudate lobe, enlarged spleen, varices
		* Nodularity does not equal cirrhosis
	* Transient elastography
		* AUROC Severe fibrosis (0.89) and Cirrhosis (0.94)

* Noninvasive Markers (grey areas)
	* FibroScan
	* APRI (< 0.3, > 2): AST to Platelet ratio
	* FIB-4 (> 3.25): combines age, AST, ALT, and platelets
	* FibroSure (> 0.8)

**Tip**: Combine tests to get greater sensitivity. Elastography + APRI or FIB-4.

Per Dr. Strangas:
* Calculate risk of fibrosis
	* APRI: 
	* Fib-4: 
	* Fibroindex, Forns criteria: use other lab tests, like GGT
	* Proprietary combination tests like Fibrosure
* Hepatic elastography - transient vibration, the speed of which tells you the stiffness of the liver
	* via ultrasound (Fibroscan)
	* MR elastography possible in the future
* Liver biopsy is still gold standard
	* high risk for bleeding


Prior treatment experience
Resistance testing

#### Readiness for treatment
Fit it into life. Psych assessment. Put support resources in place.

#### Test for Pregnancy and Prevent During Treatment
No recommendations for treatment during pregnancy. No safety information.

Do not want conception within 6 months of last dose of ribavirin.

Combined oral contraceptives are contraindicated in combination with the PROD regimen (ombitasvir-paritaprevir-ritonavir-dasabuvir).

#### Other
* Renal function
* Liver function
	* Child-Pugh for all cirrhotics
* Drug interactions
* What else?

### Treatment
* Any previous treatment
* Psych History
* Social History
* Co-morbidities
* Genotype
* Viral Load
* Hepatic Function: BMP, CBC, Hepatic Panel, INR
* HIV, HAV, HBV serologies (we’d want to treat HBV at same time, because HCV treatment can lead to B reactivation)
* Address comorbidities
	* Alcohol use
	* IVDU
	* Modify NASH/NAFLD risk factors
	* Address hepatotoxic meds
	* Vaccinate for Hep B and Hep A
	* PPSV23
	* Treat active Hep B

### Medications/Pharmacology
* Old therapy: PEG-interferon, Ribavirin
* Direct-acting anti-retrovirals (DAAs): 8-12 week course
	* Protease inhibitor:
	* Tolerable side effect profile

### Outcomes
* With DAA: Cure rates are 95%

### Who can provide treatment?
* Under Medicaid: Experienced HCV Providers
	* Treated at least 10 HCV patients within last year
	* 10 HCV-related CME

$60,000 - $160,000 for 12 week course
