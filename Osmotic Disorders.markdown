# Osmotic Disorders
_In dealing with any subject matter, find out what entities are undeniably involved, and state everything in terms of these entities._ - Bertrand Russell 1914

## Key Concept
What presents as hypo and hypernatremia are pathologies of cell volume. Use Dr. Marino’s approach to these disorders by analyzing a single variable: extracellular volume.

## Facts
* An osmole is defined as one mole of a nondissociable substance.
* Freezing point of water decreases by 1.86 ˚C for each osmole of solute added to 1 kg of water

## Hypernatremia
## Hyponatremia
### Etiologies
* Pseudohyponatremia from nonaqueous phase solutes at very high concentrations such as > 1500 mg / dL lipids or proteins above 12-15 g / dL.
* Hypotonic hyponatremia from some messed up ADH release caused by
	* Decreased BP/baroreceptor stimulation
	* “Physiologic stress”
	* “Inappropriate” ADH release

### Subdivisions of hypotonic hyponatremia

There is sodium loss, and water retention secondary to non-osmotic ADH
	* Diuretics
	* Cerebral Salt Wasting
	* Primary Adrenal Insufficiency

* Euvolemic
