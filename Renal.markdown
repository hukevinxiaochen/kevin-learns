Glomerular Filtration Rate is a function of perfusion pressures which are regulated by both efferent and afferent arterioles.

We encounter this problem commonly in patients in whom an ACE inhibitor is indicated, but whose creatinine rises (GFR decline) due to the rapid suppression of RAAS-mediated efferent arteriolar tone leading to decreased glomerular perfusion pressures and hence the overall filtration rate.
