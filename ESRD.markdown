## Hypertension
* BB have mortality benefit in ESRD in randomized studies looking at BB v CCB v A/ARB in ESRD patients without heart failure
* Ergo, use BB as first line in ESRD
* More CV events in those with A/ARB
* Ergo, use CCB as second line

### Examples
* Atenolol is a non-selective beta blocker with mortality benefit in ESRD **Source** Lisinopril v Atenolol (200 patients, RCT, IRR)

## Anemia
Untreated anemia 

Goal is 9-10.5 (KDIGO)

Treat with
* Iron
* Epo

When Hgb < 10 and Ferritin < 500
* IV Iron

## Metabolic Acidosis
GFR 40-50 , acid-base balance gets messed up

Direct association between bicarb and mortality
Lowest mortality 23-29

## Secondary Hyperparathyroidism
When greater than 5.5 persistently â€” start
If > 7.5, go for it

### Testing interval for Ca and Phos
30-59 : 6-12 mo
15-29 : 3-6 mo
Less than 15 : 1-3 mo

### Phos Binders
#### Calcium-containing
* Calcium Acetate
Vascular calcifications, hypercalcemia, adynamic bone disease

#### Non Calcium-containing
* Preferred based on limited evidence
* Sevelamer hydrochloride and Sevalamer carbonate

### Calcimimetics
Cinacalcet
To lower PTH, but this has not been shown to be associated with any mortality benefit.

### Vitamin D Analogs
Calcitriol or Paracalcitriol
