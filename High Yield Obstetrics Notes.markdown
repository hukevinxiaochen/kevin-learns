### A.A. is a 24yo woman G1P1, now two days s/p an uncomplicated NSVD.  She has questions about postpartum contraception.

**An evidence-based source for this question is the CDC Medical Eligibility for Contraception guidelines, available online or as a free app.**

#### If she wants to use OCPs, when can she start?  What if she is breastfeeding vs. not breastfeeding?

Not breastfeeding? 21 days.
Breastfeeding? 30 days if without other risk factors for VTE. 42 days if with risk factors.

#### When can she have an IUD inserted?

Anytime after placental delivery until next desired pregnancy.

Risk for uterine perforation elevated for 5 months postpartum - so it is not a factor (Heather Paladine).

#### What are the three criteria that must be true for her to rely on the lactational amenorrhea method (LAM)?

* amenorrhea;
* fully or nearly fully breastfeeding (no interval of >4â€“6 hours between breastfeeds)
* <6 months postpartum

[CDC - Lactational Amenorrhea Method - USMEC - Reproductive Health](https://www.cdc.gov/reproductivehealth/contraception/mmwr/mec/appendixg.html)

#### Can she use estrogen-containing contraception if she had high blood pressure during pregnancy?
 
Yes, but her hypertension must be resolved off medications and she cannot have ongoing preeclampsia in the 30-42 day postpartum window.


### B.B. is a 33yo woman G2P1 at 9 weeks EGA here for a first prenatal visit.

#### How much weight should a normal weight woman gain in pregnancy?  What about an obese woman?

* 28-40 for underweight (BMI 18.5)
* 25-35 for normal weight
* 15-25 for overweight (BMI 25)
* 11-20 for obese (BMI 30)

#### List three maternal consequences and three neonatal or long-term consequences in the child of excessive weight gain in pregnancy.

**Maternal**
* Cesarean section and associated morbidity and mortality (theoretical)
* Pregnancy related hypertension
* Gestational diabetes

**Neonatal and childhood**
* Childhood obesity
* Macrosomia and LGA and attendant risks such as shoulder dystocia, other birth injury
* Respiratory Distress Syndrome
