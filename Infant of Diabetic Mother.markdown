### LGA
Fractures
Brachial plexus injury

### Congenital Malformations
### RDS
6 fold higher risk compared to non-IDMs born at less than 38 weeks
### Perinatal Asphyxia
Poor tone and Poor respiratory effort at birth
Seizures in neonatal period
### Hypocalcemia
Transient hypoparathyroidism that results from hypomagnesemia
### Hematologic
Polycythemia
Hyperbilirubinemia
Venous thrombosis
### Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy
Septal hypertrophy
### Gastrointestinal
Small left colon
Intestinal hypo motility

## Diagnostic
## Management
* Euglycemia is > 50 mg/dL
* Check blood sugar 30 to 60 minutes after intervention to monitor response
* Symptomatic or severe hypoglycemia is treated with continuous IV glucose at 4-6 mg / kg / min and bolus of 2 mL/kg of 10% IV glucose to maintain euglycemia
	* Titrate every 30 to 60 min until stable
* Treat hypocalcemia with calcium gluconate
* Late preterm with RDS may benefit from surfactant
* Emergent Cardiology consult to determine need for prostaglandins in cyanotic heart disease
