## Insulin Products
### Dose insulin for new patient

### A1c correlation with fasting blood glucose
6.5% = 130 mg/dL
delta 1% = delta 30 mg/dL

### Basal (too high)
* 0.5 U/kg cutoff beyond which there are diminishing returns
* Check post-prandial

* STUDY showed Basal-Bolus versus Mixed Insulin - benefits for A1c high, fasting < 120
* Needs to have regular meals
