## History
* Mental health institutions shut down in human rights push, but Reagan presidency cut off the funding for community-based mental health resources that were supposed to supplement the support vacuum left by the closed inpatient facilities.

## Stats
* 10,000 at Riker’s Island
* 50% at Riker’s Island are being held awaiting adjudication
* 50% in detention for 10 days to 2 weeks
* 25-35% chronically or intermittently undomiciled
* 4-fold increased mortality in first year of incarceration
* 12-fold increased mortality in 2 weeks immediately following discharge from correctional facility (overdose and premature cardiovascular death) — toxic stress, dysregulated glycemia, tobacco use
