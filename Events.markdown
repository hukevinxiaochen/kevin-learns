An event is something worth reporting about the patient - something that will guide their care. For an intern, whose knowledge of management may be less robust - more things seem like events. That's appropriate.

Events take the shape of:

* Patient complaints
* Nurse reports
* Consultant notes
* Major discussions
* Vital sign fluctuations
* Lab values and studies whose results have come back
* Additional labs and studies ordered
* New assessments of the patient
* And more!!!
