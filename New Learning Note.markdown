# Extrapyramidal Effects of Medications
* Any dopamine antagonist that crosses the blood brain barrier can cause EPS
	* Metoclopramide reactions occur with high doses and within 24-48 hours after initiation of therapy
		* Reverse Metaclopramide-induced dystonia with diphenhydramine or benztropine (anticholinergic)
	* Many antipsychotics

# Ethylene Glycol Poisoning
* Anion gap metabolic acidosis with Kussmaul respirations (deep and rapid breaths)

# Breast
## Nipple Discharge
### Pathologic
* Nipple discharge is pathologic if unilateral, spontaneous, or persistent and pathologic discharge warrants breast imaging.
	* Breast imaging for women older than 30 includes mammography and ultrasound.
	* Under 30 women can get only ultrasound with or without mammography.
	* Most common cause is benign papillary tumor.

### Benign
* Bilateral, multiductal, and expressed only with manipulation of breast
* Still requires breast imaging with mammography and ultrasound
	* If normal, go for a galactorrhea evaluation with prolactin and thyroid hormone levels

## Mass
### Palpable
* Get imaging
	* Ultrasound plus or minus mammography for less than 30 years of age
	* Mammography plus ultrasound for greater than 30 years of age
	* Core biopsy needs to happen for complex cysts and any findings on mammography suspicious for malignancy

### Types
* Cyst
	* Simple cysts are not septated, and thin-walled
		* If symptomatic and painful, can be managed with fine needle aspiration followed by ultrasound 4-6 weeks later assuming the aspirate is non-bloody or the symptoms resolve
	* Complex cysts need biopsy to exclude malignancy
* Abscess needs management with antibiotics and would present with fever
* Lobular Carcinoma In Situ
	* Get excisional biopsy because high rates of upstaging to DCIS or invasive breast cancer
	* Close surveillance at minimum if patient refuses
## Obtain Genetic Testing for Breast Cancer Genes if
* 2 first degree relative with breast cancer
* 3 first or second degree relatives with breast cancer
* 1st or 2nd degree relative with breast and ovarian cancer
* 1st degree relative with bilateral breast cancer
* breast cancer in a male relative
* Ashkenazi Jewish with any 1st degree or 2nd degree relative with breast or ovarian cancer

# Premenstrual Syndrome or Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder
* Try SSRI
* Try another
* Or a combined hormonal contraceptive
* Lifetime risk of depression or other mood disorder 80%

# Stress Urinary Incontinence
* Usually due to urethral hypermobility
* Rarely due to urethral sphincter dysfunction that usually results from pelvic surgery or vaginal deliveries

# Endometrial Cancer
* Screen only when indicated in postmenopausal bleeding
* Tamoxifen increases risk, but is not a reason to go for asymptomatic screening

# Antiphospholipid Antibody Syndrome
## Diagnosis
1 clinical and 1 or more lab criteria on two or more occasions at least 12 weeks apart

### Clinical
* Arterial or Venous thrombosis
* Greater than or equal to 3 consecutive unexplained pregnancy losses before 10th week
* Greater than or equal to 1 unexplained pregnancy loss after 10th week
* Greater than or equal to 1 premature birth of neonate before 34th week due to preeclampsia, eclampsia, or placental insufficiency

### Laboratory
* Lupus anticoagulant
* Anticardiolipin antibody (IgG or IgM with medium to high titer, greater than 40 units)
* Anti-beta-2 glycoprotein 1 antibody (IgG or IgM with high titer, greater than 40 units)

## Perineal Repair Suture Options
* In a sample of 400 women with episiotomies:
	* Vicryl compared to Sutures associated with:
		* Less perineal pain at 3-5 days compared to Chromic
		* Less need for analgesia at 3-5 days
		* Reduced wound dehiscence and indurations
		* Absence of infections compared to a rate of 3.5%
