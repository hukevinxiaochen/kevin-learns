## Electrophysiology
Adenosine has substantial electrophysiologic effects on specialized conduction tissues, especially the SA and AV nodes. By binding to speciﬁc adenosine receptors, it activates potassium channels (Fig. 17.15). The resultant increase in the outward potassium current hyperpolarizes the membrane, which suppresses spontaneous depolarization of the SA node and slows conduction through the AV node. In addition, adenosine decreases the intracellular cAMP concentration by inhibiting adenylate cyclase. The result is a decrease in the inward pacemaker current (I f ) and the inward calcium current (see Fig. 17.15). Thus, the net effect of adenosine is to slow the SA node ﬁring rate and to decrease AV nodal conduction.

## Vasoactive
Adenosine is a potent vasodilator and is thought to be the prime metabolic mediator of vascular tone. By binding to receptors on vascular smooth muscle, adenosine decreases calcium entry into cells, which leads to relaxation, vasodilatation, and increased coronary blood flow.
