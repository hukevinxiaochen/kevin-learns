USPSTF GRADE of recommendations

Grade |	Definition	| Suggestions for Practice
--------------------------------------------------
A	| The USPSTF recommends the service. There is high certainty that the net benefit is substantial.	| Offer or provide this service.
B	| The USPSTF recommends the service. There is high certainty that the net benefit is moderate or there is moderate certainty that the net benefit is moderate to substantial.	| Offer or provide this service.
C	| The USPSTF recommends selectively offering or providing this service to individual patients based on professional judgment and patient preferences. There is at least moderate certainty that the net benefit is small.	| Offer or provide this service for selected patients depending on individual circumstances.
D	| The USPSTF recommends against the service. There is moderate or high certainty that the service has no net benefit or that the harms outweigh the benefits.	| Discourage the use of this service.
I | Statement	The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of the service. Evidence is lacking, of poor quality, or conflicting, and the balance of benefits and harms cannot be determined.	| Read the clinical considerations section of USPSTF Recommendation Statement. If the service is offered, patients should understand the uncertainty about the balance of benefits and harms.
