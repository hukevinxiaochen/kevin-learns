## Metformin
* For:
	* Patients on Metformin
* Monitor:
	* Serum creatinine annually
	* eGFR 45 mL to 60 mL per minute per 1.73 m2:
		* More frequent monitoring (every 3 to 6 months) and a maximum dose of 2,000 mg per day (ADA [Lipska 2011]; Inzucchi 2014).
	* eGFR 30 to 45 mL/minute/1.73 m2:
		* If continuing therapy, a dosage reduction of 50% (maximum: 1,000 mg/day) and monitoring of renal function every 3 months is recommended (ADA [Lipska 2011]; Inzucchi 2014).
	* eGFR < 30:
		* Discontinue. It is contraindicated
	
* For:
	* Patients with an indication for Metformin
	* eGFR 30 to 45 mL per min per 1.73 m 2
		* Use is not recommended for initiation of therapy by some experts (AACE [Garber 2017]; ADA [Lipska 2011]; Inzucchi 2014)
		* However, others recommend that in the absence of active kidney disease and_or conditions that predispose to hypoperfusion and hypoxemia (eg, acute heart failure, dehydration), therapy may be initiated at half the usual initial dose (eg, 250 mg_day) with close monitoring and titration (maximum: 1,000 mg/day) (McCulloch 2018c).
