## Symptom Quality
* Dizziness
* Vertigo
* Unsteadiness

Nobody cares per an ED study

## Timing and Triggers
* Focus on this
* Can help us figure out peripheral or central
* Central may be dangerous, peripheral benign
* Continuous non-triggered dizziness is most consistent with central

## TiTrATE
* Ti-Timing
* Tr-Triggers
* A Targeted Exam

#### Episodic triggered
Movement triggered, Brief

* BPPV
* Orthostatic

#### Episodic spontaneous
* Meniere
* Vestibular Migraine
* Anxiety

#### Continuous vestibular
* Vestibular neuritis - self-resolves
* Central etiologies

### A Targeted Exam
* Orthostatic Vitals
* [[Dix Hallpike]]
* Neurologic Exam

Only for continuous vestibular
HINTS - head impulse, nystagmus, test of skew; distinguishes vestibular neuritis from possible stroke

## Limited Labs
* HTN DM: Lytes and Glucose
* Cardiac symptoms: EKG, Holter, Doppler
* Abnormal Neuro Findings: MRI

## Medication / Polypharmacy Reduction
* 23% of dizziness in older adults > 5 meds associated with increased risk of dizziness
