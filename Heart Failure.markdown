## Presentation
“Syndrome of exercise intolerance and dyspnea due to cardiac dysfunction” - Gerald Neuberg, MD

“HF is a clinical syndrome characterized by typical symptoms (e.g. breathlessness, ankle swelling and fatigue) that may be accompanied by signs (e.g. elevated jugular venous pressure, pulmonary crackles and peripheral oedema) caused by a structural and-or functional cardiac abnormality, resulting in a reduced cardiac output and-or elevated intracardiac pressures at rest or during stress.” - [ESC 2016](https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article/37/27/2129/1748921#109986769)

## Differential
### Cardiovascular
Heart failure
Ischemic heart disease
Arrhythmia
Peripheral artery disease

### Pulmonary
Lung disease
Pulmonary emboli
Pulmonary arterial hypertension

### Miscellaneous
Acid-base disorder
Obesity
Anemia
Depression
Chronic fatigue
Chronic illness
Deconditioning

## Diagnosis
### Specific Clinical Findings
#### History
* Orthopnea
* Paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea
* Recumbent cough

Less specific:
* Headaches
* Nausea
* Anorexia
* Changes in mental status: confusion, insomnia, anxiety, impaired memory

#### Signs
* Hepatojugular reflux
	* Persistent jugular venous distention with abdominal pressure for 1 minute and head elevated to 45 degrees
* Left atrial enlargement
* Increased right ventricular systolic pressure

### Echocardiogram
* Reduced LVEF
* Impaired Relaxation

### Diagnostic Parameters for Patients with SOB who appear dry
* Increased LV filling pressures
* Increased RVSP with exercise on stress echo
* Decreased peak O2 uptake
* Elevated biomarkers

### Classification by EF
* Normal - HFpEF (LVEF ≥ 50%)
	* Signs of impaired relaxation - Diastolic
* Mid-Range (LVEF 40-49%) - HFmrEF
* Low - Systolic Heart Failure or HFrEF (LVEF < 40%)

### NYHA
* Class I: No symptoms and no limitation in ordinary physical activity, e.g. shortness of breath when walking, climbing stairs etc.
* Class II: Mild symptoms (mild shortness of breath and/or angina) and slight limitation during ordinary activity.
* Class III: Marked limitation in activity due to symptoms, even during less-than-ordinary activity, e.g. walking short distances (20-100 m). Comfortable only at rest.
* Class IV: Severe limitations. Experiences symptoms even while at rest. Mostly bedbound patients.

```
- activity
x limitations, symptoms

I  : [----------] | Ordinary activity, Symptom free
II : [-----xxxxx] | Mild symptoms and limitation
III: [--xxxxxxxx] | Severe symptoms and limitation
IV : [xxxxxxxxxx] | Symptoms even at rest
```

### Stages
* A - at risk
* B - LV dysfunction BUT no symptoms
* C - signs and symptoms with diagnosis
* D - advanced symptoms that do not improve with treatment
	* Evaluate for transplant, VAD placement, surgery, inotrope drips, palliative or hospice care

#### LV Dysfunction Examples
* previous myocardial infarction
* LV remodeling:
	* LVH
	* Low EF
* asymptomatic valvular disease

## Diagnosis of Acute CHF Exacerbation
### BNP
< 100 pg per mL to rule out, > 400 pg per mL to diagnose HF
(**Source** Korenstein et al., “The Utility of B-Type Natriuretic Peptide in the Diagnosis of Heart Failure in the Emergency Department.”)


### NT-pro-BNP
< 300 pg per mL to rule out

To diagnose HF:
< 50 years-old : 450 pg per mL 
50-75 years-old : 900 pg per mL 
If > 75 years-old : 1800 pg per mL

_false elevations_
* Renal failure
_false lowering_
* Obesity

## Treatment
Goals: Symptom relief and mortality prevention via reduction of myocardial O2 demand, slowing heart muscle remodeling

Guideline directed medical therapy = GDMT

### Beta blocker
_Indications_
* All HF patients

_Contraindications_
* Patients with acute CHF exacerbation AND beta-blocker naive

### ACE inhibitor
_Indications_ 
* All HF patients

_Benefits_
* BP Control
* Slows down remodeling of heart muscle
* Protects kidneys
* Mortality benefit (believed to be a function of the above)

### Aldosterone Receptor Antagonists
_Indications_
* Class II-IV, EF ≤ 35%

### Hydralazine + Isosorbide Dinitrate
_Indications_
* Class III-IV

# Heart Failure
# BNP
* Pre-discharge risk assessment?

False positives
Renal failure
AFib
Pulmonary embolism
Right heart failure
Sepsis
Critical illness

False negatives
Obesity

HFpEF < HFrEF, but overlap

# Types
LVEF < 40 is rEF, non-seniors
LVEF > 50 is pEF, seniors

# Causes
## Ischemic
## Dilated cardiomyopathy
* stress, permpartum
* tachycardia-induced
* idiopathic
* toxic-metabolic
* inflammatory
* chronic overload
## Nonmyocardial
* high output (anemia, AV fistula)
* volume overload
* valvular disease
* pericardial
## Diastolic dysfunction
* aging, LVH, ischemia
* hypertrophic
* restrictive - amyloid, low QRS voltage, AFib, conduction defects, sparkling echoes, free light chain work-up

HFpEF, not otherwise specified

Owan T et al NEJM 2006

# HFpEF
Mortality < HFrEF when corrected for age/co-morbidity

# Exacerbation Triggers
Volume overload
* dietary
* non compliance
* renal failure
* NSAIDs can cause fluid retention, glitazones, gliptins

Medical illness
* infection
* anemia
* TSH
* pulmonary disease
* sleep apnea

Cardiac events
* uncontrolled HTN
* ischemia or MI
* endocarditis
* chordal rupture
* LBBB

Drug and toxins
* negative inotropes

# Cardiorenal
Renal congestion occurs in overloaded heart failure patients

# Stages
A - at risk
B - asymptomatic LV dysfunction; ACE or ARB, Beta block, 
C - 
D - refractory

# Treatment
SPRINT trial showed that intensive BP control in patients at increased risk (<130/80) associated with HR 0.67 for development of HF (at what time point?)

# Hidden fluid
Orthopnea without rales or pulmonary edema may still benefit from diuretics

# Overdiuresis
Dizziness
Orthostasis
Hypotension
Azotemia
Decreased BUN or Increased BUN on ACE/ARB initiation

Ability to tolerate guideline medications
# Beta blockers
Keep during mild exacerbation

Metoprolol succinate is approved for use in heart failure
# Aldosterone blockers
Spironolactone
Eplerenone

# New K binder
Patiromer
# Hydralazine-Isosorbide in HF
* balanced pre-afterload reduction

# A-HeFT
NEJM 2004

Huge benefit for African American patients

AA = nitric oxide deficiency

_GNB3* TT - G protein beta-3-subunit ?_


# ARISTOTLE
Digoxin levels > 1.2 associated with excess mortality
New digoxin users Lopes, Duke, ACC 2017 > 4.0

Use propensity matching

# Treatment for HFpEF
Diuretics for congestion, but pre-load dependent (except old ladies)

Spironolactone TOPCAT worked in USA, but not Europe
