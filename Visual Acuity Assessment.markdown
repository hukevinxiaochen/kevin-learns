* Hold a standard Snellen card 20 feet from patient or a non-standard Snellen card at the recommended equivalent distance.
* Ask them to test each eye individually and then together.
* Test by asking the patient to read the lowest line that they can.
* The first number in visual acuity corresponds to the distance the patient is from the Snellen card and the second represents the distance at which a normal eye would be able to read a given line.
