## Epidemiology
* Evolution in USA in last 25 years (CDC, Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System) demonstrates steady increase, now roughly 14%?
* By race and ethnicity : roughly double prevalence in any minority race category (NHANES, JAMA 2015)
	* Undiagnosed diabetes comprises ~33%
		* Method: NHANES mobile vans go around testing people who answer surveys saying “No” to having diabetes
* Relationship to BMI

## Prevention
* Motivation
* Prediabetes
	* **Reversible**
	* Prevalence relatively equal across race categories
	* Related to Cardiovascular disease, neuropathy, retinopathy, premature mortality (and not just at high ends of hyperglycemia)
		* _Composite cardiovascular benefit trials show_ that SGLT-2 inhibitor benefit is from diuretic effect volume status control and prevention of hospitalizations due to heart failure
		* _Also_ Hypoglycemia increases cardiovascular risk
* Landmark Trials in Diabetes Prevention
	* Interventions included intensive diet and physical activity programs
		* 16-session over 24 weeks, then monthly
		* 2 principal goals : 7% of initial body weight loss and 150 minutes of exercise / week 
	* Criteria were IFG and IGT
	* Outcomes show 31% reduction in diabetes incidence at 1 year and durable effects over long term
		* Metformin - “the gift that keeps on giving” 31% —> 18%
			* Worked well in women with history of GDM, African American groups, and persons with BMI > 35
		* Microvascular outcomes also reduced
		* Cardiovascular endpoints also reduced
		* Treating 100 adults with pre diabetes for 3 years…
			* Prevents 15 new cases of diabetes…
		* Small Weight Loss matters
			* 2.2 lbs, kg leads to 16% reduction in risk of diabetes
* Real-world Lifestyle Intervention
	* 1 year program
	* Group format
	* Diverse community-based organizations
		* YMCA
		* Churches
		* Clinics
### Of note
* Huge weight swings
* Medicare covers DPP now
	* HabitNu DPP (for-profit)

### Resources
