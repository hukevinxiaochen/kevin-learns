* Diagnosis is subjective, based on history and physical
	* Neuroimage when:
		* significant neurologic deficit is present, e.g. myotomal weakness or myelopathy
		* risk of atypical (non degenerative) cause: neoplastic, infectious, inflammatory
		* persistent symptoms that do not resolve with 4 to 6 weeks of therapy
	* Imaging Facts
		* Case series of 100 patients (Teresi, 1987) referred for MRI of larynx without symptoms referrable to cervical spine demonstrated:
			* Disc protrusion in 25% of those aged 45 to 54, 42% of those aged 65 and older.
	* Options
		* MRI without contrast for routine investigation of degenerative disease for surgical candidacy
		* MRI with gadolinium-enhanced T1 sequences when suspecting metastatic disease, osteomyelitis, inflammatory condition
		* CT myelography is gold standard
